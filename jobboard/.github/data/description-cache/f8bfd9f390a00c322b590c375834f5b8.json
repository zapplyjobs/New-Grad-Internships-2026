    "description": "Why you should consider joining: About Reacher: We're the #1 TikTok Shop partner helping brands like Under Armour, Hanes, HeyDude, and Logitech scale their affiliate marketing. We've crossed 7 figures in ARR and are looking to raise a seed round and double our team by this year. Our vision is to become the Hubspot for creator marketing, powering brands and creators to connect and grow across all commerce platforms like Youtube Shopping, Instagram Shopping, Shopify, and Amazon. Reacher will be a key infrastructure component of the creator economy. Personally, I find the space and our company exciting because we have the opportunity to implement AI for the creator economy with the largest brands and creators in the world. Your work will directly impact users on day 1. We have a highly responsive user base that depends on our product day in and day out. What you'll do as a Fall Engineering Intern: Work on real product features end-to-end with mentorship: research, design, implement, test, and ship. Talk directly to customers and help translate requirements into polished experiences. Build backend systems alongside our team (we use Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, GCP). Create responsive, delightful UIs (we use React, Tailwind, shadcn/ui). Write clean, maintainable, and testable code with guidance from senior engineers. Participate in architectural discussions and learn our engineering processes. Work with a high sense of urgency – we ship fast and learn fast. You're a fit if: You're pursuing a CS degree (or related field) and have completed core CS coursework (data structures, algorithms, etc). You've built full-stack projects through coursework, hackathons, or personal projects. You care about product impact, not just writing code. You've demonstrated ownership through internships, research, or significant personal projects. You're resourceful and comfortable with ambiguity. You figure things out. You're available for a 10-12 week Fall internship (Sept - Dec 2025). Bonus points if: You've had a previous internship at a startup or tech company. You've built and deployed web applications that real users have used. You're curious about AI, e-commerce, or automation — we work in that space. You've shipped side projects, contributed to open-source, or won hackathons. You can demonstrate strong problem-solving through competitive programming, research, or technical projects. Why join us for your Fall internship: Unlike most internships, you'll work on production code solving real problems for real customers. You'll get autonomy and ownership — no coffee runs or busy work. Your code will be in front of users within days, not months. You'll receive mentorship from a strong engineering team while having real responsibility. You'll experience the full startup journey and shape not just the product but also the company. Strong performers will receive return offers for full-time positions.",
