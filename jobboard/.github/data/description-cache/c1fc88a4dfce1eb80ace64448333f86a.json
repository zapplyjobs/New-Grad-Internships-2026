    "description": "Our vision is to transform how the world uses information to enrich life for all. Micron Technology is a world leader in innovating memory and storage solutions that accelerate the transformation of information into intelligence, inspiring the world to learn, communicate and advance faster than ever.As a machine learning engineering intern in Micron's Storage and Memory Systems pathfinding group, you will be part of a pathfinding and strategy organization that is defining and influencing the future direction of memory for high-performance compute (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems.This memory-oriented AI/ML role requires a strong good understanding of compute system architecture features like parallelism, caching, memory scaling, bandwidth and latency. Outstanding candidates who have a foundation in statistics, algorithms for signal denoising and error detection and correction are highly relevant for this role.In this role, you will analyze the impacts of emerging AI and machine learning (ML) technologies on next-generation compute and memory systems, and apply your AI/ML expertise to influence technology choices. You will support broad technology pathfinding needs that may include AI research, use case analyses, technology demonstrations, tool exploration, performance benchmarking and knowledge sharing presentations. You will have an opportunity to work with proof-of-concept computer systems comprising CPUs, GPUs, shared memory and memory accelerators. This position is in Richardson, TX.Your responsibilities may include, but are not limited to:Researching technologies and tools related to ML and AIDeveloping and analyzing AI workflows to support use case studiesCollaborating with system architects and software engineers to define and influence memory innovations for future compute systemsModifying applications and libraries for technology demonstrationsSharing knowledge with others through white papers and presentationsMinimum Qualifications:Current PhD or Master's student in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Data Science (AI) with the relevant experience below.Must not graduate before September 2026.Experience implementing AI workflows using AI/ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)Deep technical understanding of ML and AI algorithms, neural networks and models.Experience and understanding of AI denoising techniques such as CNNs, GANs and VAEsKnowledge of how compute system architecture and memory scaling impact AI and ML workflows and modelsPreferred Qualifications:Understanding and experience in neural network quantization and LoRA fine-tuning techniquesBackground in statistics and data science with experience in appropriate tools (e.g. Python, Jupyter)Understanding process variation, disturbances, wear-out and other error sources in semiconductor memories, and how it influences error detection & correction requirementsExperience with application performance benchmarking on heterogeneous (CPU + GPU) systemsExperience programming GPUs (CUDA, OpenCL, SYCL, etc.)Python and C++ programming experience in a Linux environmentFamiliarity with compute scaling, parallel computing and shared memory technologies (CXL, NvLink, UALink, OpenMP, MPI, etc.) is desiredWillingness to work on a varying mix of research- and demonstration-focused assignments depending on the changing needs of a pathfinding organizationAs a world leader in the semiconductor industry, Micron is dedicated to your personal wellbeing and professional growth.
