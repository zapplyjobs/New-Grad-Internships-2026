We’re developing new tools and capabilities to amplify the human experience. To lead this transformative shift in mobility, we’ve built a world-class team in Automated Driving, Energy & Materials, Human-Centered AI, Human Interactive Driving, Large Behavior Models, and Robotics.This is a Fall/Winter 2025 paid 13-week internship opportunity. Please note that this internship will be a hybrid in-office role.Human-Centered AIThis internship opportunity falls within the Human-Centered AI Division (HCAI). We are an integrated team of ML researchers, behavior scientists, and human-computer interaction experts. At the core of our work, we aim to support people to make better decisions by using the best of big data, technology, and insights about why we do what we do. The TeamThe Future Product Innovation team is an interdisciplinary team of researchers working at the intersection of generative artificial intelligence (AI), design, engineering, and creativity. We use advances in cognitive modeling, physiological sensing, HCI, and machine learning to support human decision making. Our mission is to accelerate design and engineering processes in the automotive industry. The InternshipWe are seeking a highly motivated and versatile PhD research intern to join our Future Product Innovation team and open up the boundaries on what is possible with Generative AI technologies in the domain of narrative-driven design and future scenario generation. The ideal candidate will have a strong background in multi-media and immersive technologies, with demonstrated interest in design and generative AI. In this project, the intern will develop immersive scenarios driven by Generative AI tools with applications to generation of immersive scenarios for inventing and evaluating strategic scenarios, future product designs, and future social trends. We will match the intern with mentors based on their experience. Over the course of the project, in addition to Future Product Innovation group meetings, the intern will also participate in all Human-Centered AI division meetings and meetings with stakeholders from relevant Toyota business groups.
