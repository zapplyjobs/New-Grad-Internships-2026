    "description": "The Mission At GRAM, we believe the next great leap for humanity will be physical, not digital. What AGI is to bits, Self-Replication (SR) is to atoms. As an SR research and deployment company, our mission is to make humanity galactic by enabling physical exponential growth. To achieve this, we are conducting foundational research across general-purpose robotics, artificial intelligence, biology, and materials science to enable SR within our lifetimes. Our first step is to challenge the consensus that robots should look like us. We believe true progress comes from optimizing for function over form. We are creating a new embodiment for intelligence, designed from first principles to build the future physical economy, on and off-world.The Role At GRAM, we believe the most profound breakthroughs happen at the intersection of disciplines. Our Research Residency is an opportunity for brilliant, mission-driven individuals to embed themselves within our core teams and work on problems that define the frontier of physical technology. This is not an internship. Residents are entrusted with challenges of the same scope and difficulty as our full-time team members, providing a chance to make a tangible impact on our ambitious roadmap. You will be paired with a dedicated mentor and work on a single, high-impact project in one of our core areas: from designing novel hardware in our \"Physical Being\" pod to architecting new algorithms in our \"Embodied Intelligence\" pod. This is a unique opportunity to see how a deep-tech company operates from the inside and to contribute to solving some of the hardest problems in robotics, AI, and materials science. Key Responsibilities Own a critical research or engineering project from conception to a clear deliverable, whether it's a new piece of hardware, a novel algorithm, or a foundational piece of software infrastructure. Bring cutting-edge ideas from the academic community into our products and help us understand how to apply them. Collaborate with our full-time engineers and scientists in design reviews, brainstorming sessions, and hands-on testing. Present your findings and results to the entire R&D team at the conclusion of your residency. Requirements Currently enrolled in or recently graduated from a PhD or Master's program in a relevant field (e.g., Robotics, CS, ME, EE, Physics), or possess an equivalent record of exceptional, self-directed project work. A demonstrated ability to rapidly prototype ideas in code (Python, C++) or hardware (CAD, electronics). A first-principles approach to problem-solving and an intense curiosity that drives you to learn new things. Experience with relevant frameworks or tools (e.g., PyTorch, ROS, SolidWorks, Altium), depending on the project area. Location This is an on-site role at our research lab in El Segundo, California. We offer significant relocation assistance for exceptional candidates. Interview Process After submitting your application, we review your portfolio and any exceptional work you've shipped. If your application demonstrates the caliber we seek, you'll enter our interview process, which is designed for speed and substance. We aim to complete it within one week from start to finish. Compensation Your total compensation reflects both the significance of early-stage equity and competitive market rates. The following is the general framework for all roles at GRAM. Company-Wide Base Salary Range: $75,000 - $300,000 USD, calibrated to your impact potential Equity: Substantial ownership stake befitting founding team members Benefits: Health, dental, and vision coverage; all meals are paid for; relocation assistance GRAM is an equal opportunity employer. We evaluate solely on capability and drive. Why Join? We are an early, focused team of scientists and engineers building the system that builds itself. GRAM is funded by leading investors and long-term visionaries. We operate without bureaucracy. Ownership and leadership flow to those who demonstrate exceptional capability, and every team member works directly on our core technology. We are based in El Segundo, the heart of America's industrial future, focused on solving one of the most important problems of our time.",
