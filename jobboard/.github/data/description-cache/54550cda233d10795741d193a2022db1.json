You will also focus on enhancing fault injection techniques across multiple domains, including voltage, clock, electromagnetic, and laser methods using learning algorithms. You&rsquo;ll design and run adaptive, data‑driven experiments that automatically tune fault‑injection parameters (type, timing, intensity, frequency) using learned models&mdash;moving beyond static, domain‑tuned heuristics to algorithms that <strong>learn and improve as new data arrives</strong>. You&rsquo;ll work hands‑on with instrumentation/test workflows and our AI/ML platform to build a closed‑loop optimization pipeline that raises failure coverage, shortens test time, and increases reproducibility.</p> <br><STRONG>Responsibilities</STRONG><br><br><br><ol><li><strong>Model‑guided parameter optimization:</strong> Build and evaluate optimization loops (Bayesian optimization, bandits, RL) that select fault‑injection parameters to maximize coverage or detection sensitivity under resource constraints.</li><li><strong>Experiment design &amp; telemetry:</strong> Define Design of Experiments/sequential experiment plans, log metrics/parameters/artifacts, and instrument robust telemetry for analysis and replay.</li><li><strong>Adaptive learning:</strong> Implement feedback loops so models update with every run, improving the next round of injections (active learning).</li><li><strong>Scalable tuning:</strong> Use distributed hyperparameter search to explore large parameter spaces efficiently.</li><li><strong>Reliability metrics:</strong> Define and track objective functions (e.g., fault detectability, coverage, time‑to‑fail, false positives/negatives), plus safety/guardrails for destructive tests.</li><li><strong>Impact demo:</strong> Deliver a working prototype that can be run by engineers via our platform (scripts + config + dashboards) and present measurable improvements vs. baseline domain‑tuned flows.</li></ol><p style=\"margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p> <br><STRONG>Qualifications</STRONG><br><br><br><ul><li>Currently pursuing a MS/PhD in EE/CE/CS or related field.</li><li>Solid Python and ML fundamentals (supervised/unsupervised learning, overfitting, uncertainty).</li><li>Experience with one optimization method (Bayesian optimization, bandits, RL) <strong>or</strong> hyperparameter tuning at scale.</li><li>Data handling/visualization (NumPy/Pandas/Matplotlib), version control (Git).</li></ul><p style=\"margin: 0px;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Aptos',sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p style=\"margin: 0px;\">Candidates who wish to be considered must be enrolled in a accredited college/university as of September 2026.
