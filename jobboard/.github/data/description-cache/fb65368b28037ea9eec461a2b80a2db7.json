    "description": "Tenstorrent is leading the industry on cutting-edge AI technology, revolutionizing performance expectations, ease of use, and cost efficiency. With AI redefining the computing paradigm, solutions must evolve to unify innovations in software models, compilers, platforms, networking, and semiconductors. Our diverse team of technologists have developed a high performance RISC-V CPU from scratch, and share a passion for AI and a deep desire to build the best AI platform possible. We value collaboration, curiosity, and a commitment to solving hard problems. We are growing our team and looking for contributors of all seniorities.We are seeking a passionate and driven Machine Learning Engineer Intern to assist in the development and optimization of machine learning algorithms and models on Tenstorrent devices. This internship will provide you with hands-on experience working with industry-leading technologies and will involve collaboration with cross-functional teams. This role is on-site, based out of Santa Clara. Responsibilities: Understand how models map onto the Tenstorrent devices through compilation steps and kernels, investigate any gaps in functionality and performance, propose innovative solutions to mitigate any issues. Implement or improve kernels for computation and data movement. Conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of different approaches on various hardware platforms. Increase model and software stack robustness by devising benchmarking experiments and CI/CD pipelines. Stay current with the latest research and developments in the field of machine learning and AI, applying relevant advancements to our projects. Experience & Qualifications: Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or a related field. Strong understanding of machine learning concepts (especially LLMs and CNNs) and frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). Experience with programming languages such as Python, C++, and CUDA. Familiarity with data processing and analysis tools (e.g., NumPy, Pandas). Knowledge of hardware architectures and performance optimization is a plus. Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with attention to detail. Excellent communication skills and ability to work collaboratively in a team environment. Compensation for all interns at Tenstorrent ranges from $50/hr - $70/hr including base and variable compensation targets. Experience, skills, education, background and location all impact the actual offer made. Tenstorrent offers a highly competitive compensation package and benefits, and we are an equal opportunity employer. This offer of employment is contingent upon the applicant being eligible to access U.S. export-controlled technology. Due to U.S. export laws, including those codified in the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), the Company is required to ensure compliance with these laws when transferring technology to nationals of certain countries (such as EAR Country Groups D:1, E1, and E2). These requirements apply to persons located in the U.S. and all countries outside the U.S. As the position offered will have direct and/or indirect access to information, systems, or technologies subject to these laws, the offer may be contingent upon your citizenship/permanent residency status or ability to obtain prior license approval from the U.S. Commerce Department or applicable federal agency. If employment is not possible due to U.S. export laws, any offer of employment will be rescinded.",
