    "description": "At Cadence, we hire and develop leaders and innovators who want to make an impact on the world of technology.The circuit simulation intern will assist R&D staff in developing new algorithms and software for the Spectre FX circuit simulator. Job duties may include hands-on experience in researching new algorithmic approaches, software engineering to implement new features, performing software validation and testing, and investigating performance/accuracy issues in the simulator.Applicant should have previous exposure to the circuit simulation area and experience in EDA-relevant software development, particular C/C++ unix development. Background in one or more of numerical techniques for VLSI circuit simulation or related general numerical simulation algorithms (numerical linear algebra, computational electromagnetics, parallel numerical algorithms), EDA algorithms based on graph theory, or software optimization is required. Applicant should be a candidate for an advanced degree in the electrical engineering, computer science, or related field. Understanding of analog/memory/custom IC design and verification practices is a strong plus.We’re doing work that matters. Help us solve what others can’t.",
