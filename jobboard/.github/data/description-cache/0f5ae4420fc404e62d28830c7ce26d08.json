    "description": "About us B2B payments are a multi-trillion-dollar industry and, as the industry pushes further into digitization and faster settlement, fraud has become a massive problem — to the tune of $43B in annual losses. Walrus is the leader in B2B payment verification, with clients that include some of the biggest names in investment management. Our DoubleCheck platform combines advanced authentication, proprietary technology, AI, and novel UX to collect and confirm payment details.

We are an early-stage company, so you and the team will work together to create standards and culture that will endure for years to come. Of course you’ll get to design and innovate solutions to hard problems, and write a lot of code. But beyond that, as all entrepreneurial software teams do, you’ll be able to design ways of approaching software development. We are looking for people who are thoughtful, not only about software problems, but about how teams work together to solve them, and how people collaborate to build an energizing and supportive workplace. About you You are someone who cares a lot about designing software in a thoughtful way that takes into account bug prevention, testability, and maintainability. You are comfortable with the idea that product design should be data-driven, using evidence rather than opinion. You are: Experienced with tools for testing. You know that the best software developers demonstrate that their code works, rather than dumping it on a QA department. Curious, and have an interest in teaching and learning from your colleagues. A strong written communicator. Graduating in December 2026, anytime 2027, or spring 2028 with an undergraduate degree in computer science, math, physics, or electrical engineering. Optionally We strongly encourage you to apply even if you don't meet all the criteria listed; the description is meant to be indicative, not a precise description of a pigeonhole. You have internship or co-op experience designing, building, and deploying sophisticated web applications. You have experience with modern UI frameworks, web standards, and web development best practices. You have a detailed understanding of the design of data models for use in relational databases. You have used cloud infrastructure to deploy reliable and scalable web applications. You have built authentication flows and/or implemented secure APIs. You have built or used tools for data analysis, performance profiling, and debugging. What it’s like to work with us We’re a tight-knit, early-stage team that’s focused on building a product that our customers love. We have a strong company culture based on collaboration, ownership, and mentoring. We meet sparingly and efficiently. We understand our innate biases and celebrate diversity. We have a low-ego workplace, where we provide the tools for everyone to do their best work. You will work closely with the leadership team, and have room for extensive growth within the company.
