Achieving Truveta’ s ambitious vision requires an incredible team of talented and inspired people with a special combination of health, software and big data experience who share our company values. Our headquarters are in the greater Seattle area, but we celebrate and embrace a remote culture. Participation in the internship program requires that you are physically present in the United States for the duration of the internship. #LI-remote Who We Need We are seeking a highly motivated and talented Machine Learning PhD Intern to join our AI research team and contribute to our innovative projects in the field of Large Language Modeling (LLM) and clinical data analysis. Beyond core capabilities, we are seeking problem solvers, passionate and collaborative teammates, and those willing to roll up their sleeves while making a difference. If you are interested in the opportunity to pursue purposeful work, join a mission-driven team, and build a rewarding career while having fun, Truveta may be the perfect fit for you. Internship Details Our Research PhD Internship is designed for candidates who have finished their classes and are working only on research work to complete their PhD. Candidates must be within 1 year of their graduation date from their PhD program. Candidates are expected to demonstrate both independence in defining their research strategy within a domain as well as an ability to apply innovative solutions to our products. Our internships are designed to be a minimum of 10 weeks with the opportunity to extend beyond the initially agreed term based on the company’s needs and the candidate’s desires. This Opportunity We are looking for machine learning experts who can utilize applied science and software development skills in building our Foundation Models that help us address some of the hardest problems towards our vision of Saving Lives with Data. You will work in an exciting and fast-paced environment, collaborating closely with multiple teams across the company. You will work as part of an organization that brings together talent from diverse backgrounds including software engineering, big data, machine learning and AI, clinical informatics, and medicine making our team an exciting place to work.
