    "description": "<p><strong>About 1X</strong><br />We’re an AI and robotics company based in Palo Alto, California, on a mission to build a truly abundant society through general‑purpose robots capable of performing any kind of work autonomously.<br />We believe that to truly understand the world and grow in intelligence, humanoid robots must live and learn alongside us. That’s why we’re focused on developing friendly home robots designed to integrate seamlessly into everyday life.<br />We’re looking for curious, driven, and passionate people who want to help shape the future of robotics and AI. If this mission excites you, we’d be thrilled to hear from you and explore how you might contribute to our journey.<br /></p><p><strong>Role Overview</strong><br />The AI Residency is a fixed‑term role (3–6 months) in which you will contribute to critical AI and robotics projects alongside full‑time team members. You will build full‑stack infrastructure for simulation, data management, and learning, apply research‑level ideas in production settings, and help ship capabilities to robots deployed in the field. Residents tackle projects with the same scope and difficulty as those worked on by full‑time employees.<br /></p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li><p>Bring cutting‑edge ideas from the AI and robotics research community into product applications and scale them using the robot fleet’s data</p></li><li><p>Build evaluations that benchmark open‑source models on tasks useful to 1X</p></li><li><p>Build the “data engine” (frontend UI and backend) to review logs, clean data, and perform labeling</p></li><li><p>Ship new capabilities to robots deployed at customer sites</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height: 1.7em;\"></p><br></br><ul><li><p>Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent; graduate‑level students in ML or robotics preferred (exceptional applicants will be considered)</p></li><li><p>Proficiency with large codebases in Python, including writing tests</p></li><li><p>Ability to rapidly prototype ideas independently</p></li><li><p>Experience with deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX</p><p style=\"min-height: 1.7em;\"></p></li></ul><p><strong>Nice to Have</strong></p><ul><li><p>Fast thinker and learner</p></li><li><p>Highly independent code contributor</p></li><li><p>Ability to do world‑class ML research and also work on infrastructure and operational scaling</p></li><li><p>Experience with systems programming</p></li><li><p>Experience training large‑scale ML models (visual foundation models, large language models, generative models) or published research in top ML conferences</p><p style=\"min-height: 1.7em;\"></p></li></ul><p><strong>Compensation</strong></p><ul><li><p>Salary: approximately $10,000 per month</p><p style=\"min-height: 1.7em;\"></p></li></ul><p><strong>Equal Opportunity Employer</strong><br />1X is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
