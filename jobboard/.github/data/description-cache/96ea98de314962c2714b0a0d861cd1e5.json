JOB DESCRIPTION AND POSITION REQUIREMENTSThe Geospatial, Imaging, and Data Sciences Division (GIDS) of the Applied Research Laboratory is seeking undergraduate students for internship opportunities. ARL’s purpose is to research and develop innovative solutions to challenging scientific, engineering, and technology problems in support of the Navy, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Intel Community (IC).Typical duties include research and development in areas such as defense, law enforcement, security, disaster relief, human geography, disaster preparedness, and first response. Our team is interested in both undergraduate-level and graduate level student interns.ARL is an authorized DoD SkillBridge partner and welcomes all transitioning military members to apply.You will:Collaborate with geospatial data analysts to understand and automate workflows and improve human processes to advance the discovery and modeling of associations, trends, patterns and system dynamicsCreate processes and algorithms to transform traditional GEOINT and open-source data into spatial-temporal information describing places, events, and activitiesCombine full spectrum source data with modeling capabilities that associate real world objects to known signatures and doctrinesDevelop the ability to discover and capture information from geospatial data to better represent the most advanced understanding of world events, systems, and discrete entitiesApply the scientific method across multiple disciplines to advance Data and Geospatial Sciences and develop data analytics through systematic experimentationConduct experiment-driven applied research and developmentConduct analysis and complete scientific research projects and develop geospatial algorithms while collaborating among diverse domains to further scientific understanding and analytic toolsGrow career and capabilities, plan and conduct applied research, provide technical guidance and oversight, contribute to large research efforts, report results, foster trusted relationships with sponsors, and advise on new and evolving technology and techniquesResearch team members will receive technical and professional mentorship to learn about conducting efficient experiment-driven applied research investigations on diverse multi-disciplinary teamsEngage in research efforts ranging from proof-of-concept through integrated production systemsStudents studying Mathematics, Engineering, or Computer Science are encouraged to apply.Required skills/experience areas include:Python, R, Java, C++, or MatlabPrevious success with collaborations in a diverse, multi-disciplinary, team-oriented cultureRelevant experience or coursework in a field directly applicable or highly related to Data Sciences, Engineering, Computer Sciences, or Geospatial SciencesAbility to design experiments, perform analysis, and design or apply meaningful metrics to measure resultsDemonstrated ability to adapt and learn new skills, execute specific research projects, and meet task deadlines and goalsStrong ability to clearly communicate ideas and information to ensure mutual understandingPreferred skills/experience areas include:Ability to utilize Git for distributed version control and team collaborationGUI developmentOpen-source scientific computationComputer visionModelingMachine learning toolsThe successful candidate will work up to 20 hours/week during the fall and spring semesters and 40 hours/week over the summer.This is a paid internship located at ARL's Main Lab Building at the University Park Campus; relocation and housing are not provided.ARL’s purpose is to research and develop innovative solutions to challenging scientific, engineering, and technology problems in support of the Navy, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Intel Community (IC). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION on ARL, please visit our web site at www.arl.psu.edu. BACKGROUND CHECKS/CLEARANCESEmployment with the University will require successful completion of background check(s) in accordance with University policies. All positions at ARL require candidates to possess the ability to obtain a government security clearance; you will be notified during the interview process if this position is subject to a government background investigation. You must be a U.S. citizen to apply. Employment with the ARL will require successful completion of a pre-employment drug screen. CAMPUS SECURITY CRIME STATISTICSPursuant to the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act and the Pennsylvania Act of 1988, Penn State publishes a combined Annual Security and Annual Fire Safety Report (ASR). The ASR includes crime statistics and institutional policies concerning campus security, such as those concerning alcohol and drug use, crime prevention, the reporting of crimes, sexual assault, and other matters. The ASR is available for review here. EEO IS THE LAWPenn State is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to providing employment opportunities to all qualified applicants without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability or protected veteran status.
