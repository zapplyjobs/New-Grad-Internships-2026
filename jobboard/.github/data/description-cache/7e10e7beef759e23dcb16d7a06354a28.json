    "description": "Location: New York, fully in-office (no remote work) Dates: 15th June 2026 – 21st August 2026 About the Programme Get a taste of working in a fast-paced, tech-led environment in our New York office. Our intern programme provides the opportunity to work directly with our Development teams. These projects support areas such as Finance, Operations, Risk, Trading, and Portfolio Management. During your internship, you will gain valuable hands-on experience with a multitude of technologies and disciplines such as devops, data engineering, cyber security, web development, business intelligence, software engineering, and stream processing. What do we want? This internship is ideal for an innovative problem solver who can demonstrate inventive and creative use of technology. Successful participants will have the possibility to return full time as a graduate when they complete their studies. We don’t specifically look for those on a Computer Science degree but, do look for those who have actively developed technical, programming skills. This could be on previous internship programmes, through hackathon involvement or even just completing passion projects in your free time. We also look for those with exceptional academic achievement and impressive communication and collaboration skills. Finally, we also believe that the right person is more than just a technical expert. We place real value on team-working, entrepreneurialism and strong communication skills. This isn’t a scheme for someone who wants to sit quietly behind a desk. Note, our programme in New York is only open to penultimate year students graduating in 2027. We are also only able to consider those with permanent authorization to work in the US. What’s involved? During the internship programme, you will hone your software and programming skills whilst building an understanding of our business and financial markets. You’ll join a cutting-edge team with the ability to assume as much responsibility and autonomy as you can take on. The selection of intern projects is a collaborative process. The entire Technology team is invited to propose project ideas that could potentially benefit the team or the wider business. Senior managers then choose the projects that promise the most significant impact. You will collaborate directly with the team that proposed the project, typically working in pairs. Throughout your internship, you will receive comprehensive support from our teams, starting from an initial induction to a performance review upon completion of your tenure. This support includes personalized mentoring, regular seminars with senior managers and key staff, social events, and opportunities to engage in the firm’s charitable activities. At the conclusion of your internship, you will present your project to the Technology team. To give a flavour of the sorts of work our interns do however, some project examples are: Integrating AI tools into bespoke systems. Creating a UI to visualise and explore connections across our estate. Building alert tooling. Why join us? Technology is at our core. It’s industry-defining and best-in-class, but we are striving for even more. You’ll have the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies while learning from some of the best technicians in the business. As a technology intern, this is a chance to accelerate your skill set and gain invaluable real-world experience. Progression at Marshall Wace The aim of our internships is to convert the best performers into graduates. The rotational format of our graduate program then allows you to explore various roles within the Technology team before determining the best fit for you. Upon completing your rotations, you have the flexibility to advance to the team that aligns most with your interests and strengths. After completing the program, the progression paths are not rigidly defined. There is no predetermined ladder for you to climb. Instead, your personal growth may involve taking on more challenging projects, mentoring a team or new hires, or even pursuing opportunities for international assignments. Your individual development path is open for exploration, and you can collaborate with your management to shape what your future growth looks like. Marshall Wace is an equal opportunity employer. Individuals seeking employment are considered without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, or any other category protected by applicable law. Note: we request that you only apply to the one role you are most interested in. This includes both the position itself and the location. Duplicate applications will cause delays in processing your application. In accordance with applicable law, the base salary range for this role is $2,800 to $3,000 per week.",
