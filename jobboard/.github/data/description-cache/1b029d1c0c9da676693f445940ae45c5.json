    "description": "By submitting your resume, you’re expressing interest in one of our 2026 Systems Software Engineering Internships. We’ll review resumes on an ongoing basis, and a recruiter may reach out if your experience fits one of our many internship opportunities. NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to tackle challenges no one else can solve. Our work in AI and digital twins is transforming the world's largest industries and profoundly impacting society — from gaming to robotics, self-driving cars to life-saving healthcare, climate change to virtual worlds where we can all connect and create. Our internships offer an excellent opportunity to expand your career and get hands on experience with one of our industry leading Systems Software teams. We’re seeking strategic, ambitious, hard-working, and creative individuals who are passionate about helping us tackle challenges no one else can solve. Throughout the 12-week minimum full-time internship, students will work on projects that have a measurable impact on our business. We’re looking for students pursuing Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD degree within a relevant or related field. Potential Internships in this field include: Systems Software Defining, designing, and developing integrated (e.g., Jetson Orin) and discrete (e.g., Hopper H100) GPU system software components (e.g., runtime, math libraries) with focus on power and performance, as well as creating architecture and design specifications Course or internship experience related to the following areas could be required: Operating Systems (Threads, Process Control, Memory/Resource Management, Virtual Memory), Multithreaded Debugging, Linux Kernel Development, RTOS Development on Embedded Platforms, Data Structures & Algorithms (time/space complexity), Computer Networking (TPC/IP, OSI Model, Sockets) Graphics Systems Software Designing and implementing of OpenGL, OpenGL ES, and Vulkan graphics drivers, platform support, and conformance tests to support new hardware features in collaboration with other software, hardware, architecture, and support teams Training and debugging various issues within the Tegra graphics software stack Course or internship experience related to the following areas could be required: Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Real-Time Systems Development, Device Driver Programming, Game Console Middleware, or other Low-Level Library Development, 3D/2D Graphics Theory, Implementation & Optimizations, Simulation or Emulation (writing & debugging tests) Compiler Working at the center of deep-learning compiler technology, spanning architecture design and support through functional languages Investigating problems or optimization opportunities within the Compiler backend by working with global compiler, hardware, and application teams to oversee improvements and problem resolutions Course or internship experience related to the following areas could be required: Operating Systems Compiler, Compiler Construction, Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures, Computer Architecture, Compiler Development, Open Source Programming, High-Performance Computing (HPC), Automation Tools (XLA, TVM, Halide), Open Source Tools (CLANG, LLBM, gcc) Firmware & Embedded Software Supporting development of firmware run on embedded microcontrollers within GPUs, while optimizing software to improve system robustness, performance, and security Participating in testing new and existing firmware, and developing tools and infrastructure to improve our front-end design and verification process Course or internship experience related to the following areas could be required: Operating Systems (Threads, Process Control, Memory/Resource Management, Virtual Memory), Embedded Systems (Processors, Firmware, Input/Output Devices and Memory), Real-Time Performance, Low-Level Development, Data Structures & Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Computer Systems Software, Linux Kernel Development, Multi-Threaded or Multi-Process Programming, RTOS Development on Embedded Platforms Software Security Hardening and developing secure solutions across the software stack, spanning multi-node supercomputers down to microcontrollers and security co-processors Building tools and infrastructure to scale security efforts across large organizations and codebases with millions of lines of code Course or internship experience related to the following areas could be required: Operating Systems, Data Structures & Algorithms, Computer Networking, Network Security, Cryptography, Computer Systems Architecture, Microcontroller and Microprocessor fundamentals (Caches, Buses, Memory Controllers, DMA, etc.) What we need to see: Must be actively enrolled in a university pursuing a Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or a related field, for the entire duration of the internship. Depending on the internship role, prior experience or knowledge requirements could include the following programming skills and technologies: C, C++, CUDA, x86, ARM CPU, GPU, Embedded C, Linux, Linux Kernel Development, Perl, Bash/Shell Scripting Operating Systems (Threads, Process Control, Memory/Resource Management, Virtual Memory), Formal Verification Tools (Spark, Frama-C), Linux Kernel Development, Multi-Threaded or Multi-Process Programming, Computer Networking (TPC/IP, OSI Model, Sockets), Open Source Tools (CLANG, LLBM, gcc), Testing Production/Automation Tools (XLA, TVM, Halide), Microprocessor Fundamentals (Caches, Buses, Memory Controllers, DMA, etc.) Click here to learn more about NVIDIA, our early talent programs, benefits offered to students and other helpful student resources related to our latest technologies and endeavors. Our internship hourly rates are a standard pay based on the position, your location, year in school, degree, and experience. The hourly rate for our interns is 20 USD - 71 USD. You will also be eligible for Intern benefits. ​Applications are accepted on an ongoing basis.
