The Skydio team combines deep expertise in artificial intelligence, best-in-class hardware and software product development, operational excellence, and customer obsession to empower a broader, more diverse audience of drone users. From utility inspectors to first responders, soldiers in battlefield scenarios and beyond.About the role: Skydio’s mission is to make the world safer and more efficient through autonomous drones. Public safety and critical infrastructure customers rely on Drone as First Responder (DFR) to get eyes on scene in seconds and coordinate effective responses. As a full stack intern on the DFR team, you will help build workflows that span across the stack to enable responders to focus on what matters most. The DFR team spans the whole Skydio Cloud stack, from React and Relay for live operations and map‑centric UIs to backend services for incident workflows and integrations with public safety systems like CAD (computer aided dispatch) and evidence management platforms. We build in TypeScript on the frontend and collaborate closely with backend services (commonly Go and Python). As an intern, you’ll gain hands-on experience across the stack, collaborating with engineers, designers, and product managers to deliver meaningful features and learn what it takes to ship production software. How you’ll make an impact Design and implement operator-facing features that help first responders coordinate incidents and make faster, safer decisions. Leverage curiosity, technical skill, and a collaborative mindset to help make the world more productive, creative, and safe with autonomous drones. Collaborate across functions (product managers, designers, engineers, and support) to deliver high‑quality, impactful features to customers. Project examples Build operator‑facing features used daily in Drone as First Responder (DFR) to enhance existing capabilities and enable new workflows on Skydio Cloud. Create real‑time UI for live video and relaying telemetry data from the drone. Implement map‑centric interactions for placing and managing incident markers (911 calls) with clear affordances and undo/redo. Ship pre‑merge end‑to‑end tests for critical user journeys to prevent regressions and increase release confidence. What makes you a good fit Solid software engineering foundation and a commitment to writing clean, well‑architected code. Junior, senior, or MS-level student with meaningful project or internship experience developing modern web applications that connect to backend APIs and data systems. Enthusiasm for learning new technologies and collaborating within a fast‑paced team environment. Experience in modern web development (React, TypeScript, GraphQL, WebGL/Three.js). Experience building and maintaining scalable APIs, services, and integrations for handling large datasets. Bonus: familiarity with robotics software development concepts.
