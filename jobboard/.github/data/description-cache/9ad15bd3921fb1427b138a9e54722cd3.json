Media Tech Internship Program Here at NBCU, we strive to be on the forefront of leading-edge technology and are seeking a savvy troop of technologists we call Media Tech Interns. Our Media Tech internship program exposes students to technical opportunities across NBCUniversal’s Operations & Technology organizations and serves as the primary pathway for consideration into our Media Tech Associate Program – a challenging two-year rotational program for individuals with a passion for technology. Many of our past interns have gone on to join the Associate Program, which helps participants jump-start their careers by promoting technical breadth through mentorship, networking opportunities, and technical training. More information on this pipeline program can be found at nbcunicareers.com/mediatech/associate-program. As an NBCUniversal Media Tech Intern, you will gain hands-on experience, allowing you to apply your classroom knowledge to practical situations. We offer a 2-day in-person orientation in our NY office where we bring all interns together to meet each other and various business leaders. Students will experience firsthand how one of the largest media and entertainment companies in the world operates and delivers strategic, innovative solutions. Areas of placement may include, but are not limited to: Site Reliability - Automation: Our goal is to help teams reduce risk, cost, and manual effort and improve accuracy across NBCU by standardizing and implementing best practices. We provide on-prem and cloud-based development, project consultation, and full-stack automation. Automation Engineering brings deep expertise in systems architecture, process optimization, and automation to every engagement to help teams turn opportunities into lasting improvements. We are one of the few teams that provide tailored solutions for all groups in the company. Our normal workload primarily consists of the development of Ansible roles / tasks related to automate tasks for Corporate and Media systems and / or applications. Depending on what projects are active at the time, there would also likely be development activities related to one of our home-grown portals (using React or similar Javascript framework). We are also picking up some fairly complex AI related projects as well that we expect the intern to be working on. Production Application Engineering: The Production Application Engineering team provides services to multiple businesses within the larger NBCU Enterprise, including the architecture and deployment of 2 internal platforms to support live news production - Virtual Production Control Room (VPCR) and NBCU Forge. VPCR leverages public cloud for elastic expansion of resources to deliver live news in markets across the US, reducing the time needed to produce new content for different platforms. Forge is meant to ease the onboarding of vendor solutions into the NBCU ecosystem by building a framework that can be leveraged for different projects without rebuilding the underlying platform. Global Network Engineering, WiFi: The Wi-Fi team is part of the NBC Global Network Engineering team which operates all internet connectivity for NBCU internal businesses. We are tasked to install, enhance, troubleshoot, and excel the Wi-Fi network to provide users with a seamless and fast user experience. We are constantly trying to evolve our process, tooling, and methodologies to help accomplish this. Production Technology Architecture: The Production Technology Architecture team is a subset of the NBCU Production Engineering team. This group is primarily tasked with designing, implementing and configuring major broadcast production systems such as video routers, IP audio systems, and studios technology. An intern working with this team will be tasked with a large variety of tasks in these efforts, especially focused on the buildout of new control rooms and video control systems for 30 Rock production operations. PDEX, Sales & Finance Engineering: The Sales and Finance Engineering team’s mission is to build technology solutions that make our Content Sales and Finance operations faster, smarter, and more efficient. An Intern on our team will gain hands-on experience with projects that enable how NBCU delivers and automates the exchange of digital media assets with streaming partners, starting with Amazon Prime Video. This position provides an up-close view of how NBCU systems distribute creative content to Partners through automation, data, and collaboration across business and technology teams.
