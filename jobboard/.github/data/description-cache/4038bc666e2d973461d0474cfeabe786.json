    "description": "Sponsored by the Universities Research Association (URA), the URA-Fermilab Undergraduate Research Summer Internship (FURSI) engages undergraduate students in STEM to conduct research at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in fulfillment of its mission. The S&T portfolio of Fermilab covers the research areas of particle physics, high-energy physics, accelerator science, computational physics, engineering and emerging technologies in support of the following projects: LBNF/DUNE US, PIP-II, HL-LHC AUP & CMS, Mu2e, Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems (SQMS).Interns spend 12 weeks at Fermilab performing hands-on research under the direct leadership, guidance, and supervision of Fermilab scientists, engineers, computing professionals, technicians, and staff across all laboratory directorates performing hands-on research.FURSI fosters scientific and technical expertise, leadership, science communication, and science policy. Additional programming includes career development panels, networking events, and graduate school advising. A highlight of the program is the URA Science and Technology Policy Day in Washington DC, where students gain firsthand insight into the co-supportive process between policy and scientific research.FURSI is a stepping stone for aspiring scientists and engineers, providing a rounded and enlightening research experience that builds the foundation for future graduate studies, fellowships and leadership roles.EligibilityStudents majoring in Physics, Engineering (Mechanical, Electrical, or Computer), Computer Science, Mathematics, Data Science, Materials Science or ChemistryEnrolled full-time in a degree-granting program at a U.S. institution of higher education located in the U.S. or its territoriesUndergraduate sophomores, juniors and seniors not graduating prior to December of internship yearMust be a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR)Application Procedure Before applying have all requirements ready.
