    "description": "Persons in these roles are welcome to work remotely from Berkeley, CA. *Compensation dependent on current degree enrollment. Research Intern, Undergrad: $94,320 (Annually) Research Intern, Masters: $106,110 (Annually) Research Intern, PhD: $140,000 (Annually) Who You Are: Ai2 is seeking talented and motivated Research Interns to join the FlexOlmo team, working on a series of large language models designed for flexible data use, with a focus on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), long-context language models (LCLMs), and retrieval. Research Interns will be based in Berkeley, CA. This internship offers a unique opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research in natural language processing and machine learning in an exciting, fast-paced research environment. As a Research Intern, you have the opportunity to: Define and lead a high-impact research project. Train and release leading models. Collaborate with and learn from team members across Ai2. Build open-source software for the research community. Author scientific papers for publication in a high-profile conference or journal. Ai2 Research Internship Information: Duration: 12 weeks Start date: Flexible Candidates: A PhD candidate or a master/undergraduate student with a strong research background. We are currently hiring for start dates in 2026. If you have questions, feel free to reach out to olmo-careers@allenai.org. ​​Please apply by December 15, 2025 at 11:00pm Pacific Time to be considered for our Spring/Summer 2026 internships. Who We Are: We design new architectures and training methods that help models use data more effectively—through improved training, inference-time conditioning, and retrieval—broadening the types of data they can leverage and ultimately enhancing performance. We also develop scientific methodologies for evaluating and understanding these systems. Our team produces high-impact research and expertly engineered open-source tools that accelerate NLP research worldwide. We lead the FlexOlmo project, whose first release in July 2025 focused on a new Mixture-of-Experts architecture. Looking ahead, we plan to pursue creative, groundbreaking research that delivers scientific insights and practical solutions for building architectures and training methods that unlock the use of large and diverse data sources. Your Next Challenge: Why FlexOlmo? We are building the foundation for research into the next generation of language models designed for flexible data use. FlexOlmo is a small, tightly knit team, giving you the unique opportunity to work closely with team members toward one high-impact project. We encourage open collaboration on intern projects, even with researchers at external institutions. Interns will be based in Berkeley, with opportunities to engage actively with the University of California, Berkeley, and the BAIR lab. Our pay is competitive, and visa sponsorship is available. We are committed to open science and support students freely publishing papers, as exemplified by our first release: FlexOlmo: Open Language Models for Flexible Data Use.
