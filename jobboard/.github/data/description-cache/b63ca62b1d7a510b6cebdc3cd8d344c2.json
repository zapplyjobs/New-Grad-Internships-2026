The Microsoft Undergrad Internship Program is focused on developing talent and experience for careers in computing research. The program is a 12-week summer internship program specifically designed for advanced undergraduate students. It offers the opportunity to do state-of-the-art research in one of our US-based Microsoft Research Labs. You will work with our researchers and extended network of visiting faculty, postdoctoral researchers, data and applied scientists, engineers, designers, and doctoral students to make important contributions to new and ongoing research. One of the program’s goals is to encourage participants to pursue advanced degrees in computing fields. Your on-the-job learning will be augmented with mentoring, community building, and networking opportunities. Qualifications By the start of the internship program (~May): Candidates must be rising junior or rising senior students enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program majoring in computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, information science or related major. Candidates must have at least two years of programming experience, completed courses in Calculus, Probability and Statistics and/or Machine Learning OR demonstrated training in at least one social science methodology. We especially encourage applications from groups currently underrepresented in engineering and computer science, including those who self-identify as a woman, African American, Black, Hispanic, Latinx, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, person with a disability, and/or LGBTQI+.
