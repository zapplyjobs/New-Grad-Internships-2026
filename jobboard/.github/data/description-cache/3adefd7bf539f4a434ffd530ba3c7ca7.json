Share your resume with us today!   ​​Primary Responsibilities. ​Candidate can expect to work closely with a team of engineers and scientists to solve problems in a variety of disciplines to include EO/IR sensor systems, primarily for modeling & simulation purposes. ​Candidate is expected to have a strong academic performance that lends itself towards a technical capability to support overlapping engineering/scientific/developer disciplines.  ​Candidate is also expected to have the ability to work and to communicate effectively within a multidisciplinary team. ​ ​Basic Qualifications.   ​​Candidate must be currently enrolled and a rising junior or senior at the time of the internship in a bachelor’s degree program from an accredited university in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, engineering physics, physics, software engineering, computer science, or an equivalent engineering or scientific program. ​Experience solving problems with MATLAB/Python/C++ or equivalent. ​Must be a U.S. citizen and able to obtain and maintain a DoW security clearance. ​ ​Preferred Qualifications.  ​​In addition to the qualifications listed above, the ideal candidate should be highly organized, demonstrating the ability to work independently at times due to a fast-paced and highly productive work environment. Because the candidate may fill various project needs, an interest in working multiple programs with intermediate ability in C++, C#, and/or Python is a bonus. ​Preference may be given to candidates with one or more of the following: recent stellar academic performance in physics and/or engineering classes, a SECRET clearance or above; familiarity or interest in EO/IR phenomenology; experience with image processing; experience with GPU programming and/or CUDA programming; experience with developing AI/ML solutions.​   Come break things (in a good way). Then build them smarter.We're the tech company everyone calls when things get weird. We don’t wear capes (they’re a safety hazard), but we do solve high-stakes problems with code, caffeine, and a healthy disregard for “how it’s always been done.”Original Posting:December 17, 2025For U.S. Positions: While subject to change based on business needs, Leidos reasonably anticipates that this job requisition will remain open for at least 3 days with an anticipated close date of no earlier than 3 days after the original posting date as listed above.Pay Range:Pay Range $48,100.00 - $86,950.00The Leidos pay range for this job level is a general guideline only and not a guarantee of compensation or salary.
