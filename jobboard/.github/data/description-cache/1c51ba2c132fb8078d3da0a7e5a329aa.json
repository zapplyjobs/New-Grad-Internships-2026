    "description": "FL117 is a Flagship-backed, stealth-stage AI x Bio startup pioneering the next generation of multi-modal generative models for biomolecular design. We are building the architectures, training pipelines, and computational frameworks that will power the future of intelligent drug discovery. We are looking for extraordinary computational scientists and engineers. You will collaborate closely with an interdisciplinary team of ML researchers, computational biologists, and biophysicists to push the limits of molecular representation and generative modeling. The Role Our Co-ops will work on cutting-edge problems at the intersection of machine learning, biology, and chemistry, helping advance our molecular design platform. We use techniques such as: Multimodal generative models: diffusion, flow matching, and language models (ex: for proteins) Data-driven biophysical modeling to link molecular structure and function. Key Responsibilities: Work with an interdisciplinary team of scientists to build models and deploy models Curate and organize data from multiple publicly and proprietary sources Experiment with diverse datasets and novel techniques Communicate your work to a multi-disciplinary audience Basic Requirements: Fluency in Python and experience implementing ML methods with standard tools and packages (e.g., PyTorch, JAX). Readiness to deep dive into the biology/physics/chemistry of the platform companies we build Preferred Requirements: Experience working with RDKit, BioPython, Rosetta, OpenMM, PySCF, etc Publications or experience in CS, ML, Computational Chemistry/Biology or a similar computational field. Experience with generative models, natural language processing, graphical neural networks, reinforcement learning, or similar. Familiarity with software development, including git and public cloud computing resources (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure). The salary range for this role is $25 - $40. Compensation for the role will depend on a number of factors, including a candidate’s qualifications, skills, competencies, and experience. Flagship Pioneering currently offers healthcare coverage, annual incentive program, retirement benefits and a broad range of other benefits. Compensation and benefits information is based on Flagship Pioneering’s good faith estimate as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future.",
