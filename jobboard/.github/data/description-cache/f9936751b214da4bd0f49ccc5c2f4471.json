    "description": "Lambda, The Superintelligence Cloud, is a leader in AI cloud infrastructure serving tens of thousands of customers. Our customers range from AI researchers to enterprises and hyperscalers. Lambda's mission is to make compute as ubiquitous as electricity and give everyone the power of superintelligence. One person, one GPU. If you'd like to build the world's best AI cloud, join us. *Note: This position requires presence in our San Francisco office location 4 days per week; Lambda’s designated work from home day is currently Tuesday. Join Lambda as a Machine Learning Research Intern and help advance the frontiers of generative AI. You’ll collaborate closely with world-class researchers and engineers, leveraging Lambda’s compute to optimize model and system performance. Our interns work hands-on across two complementary tracks, Fundamental Research and Applied Research , depending on their interests and experience. What You’ll Work On Foundation Models, Multi-Modal, Agents System benchmarking and performance optimization Track 1: Fundamental Research Research in foundation models for language, vision, life sciences and robotics. Multi-modal research, including building efficient data and evaluation toolkits. Publish findings in top-tier ML Research conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV/ECCV, ACL, SIGGRAPH), and/or as technical blogs, public datasets, benchmarks, and open-source tools. Track 2: Applied Research Maximize training and inference performance for large-scale AI systems. Systematic model and agent evaluation. Publish findings in top-tier ML system conferences (e.g. MLSys, OSDI, SOSP, NSDI), and/or as technical blogs, public dataset, benchmarks, and open-source tools.
