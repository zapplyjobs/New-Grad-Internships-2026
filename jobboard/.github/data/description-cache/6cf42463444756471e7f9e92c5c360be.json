    "description": "The CompanyNorthMark Compute & Cloud (NMC²) is backed by dedicated leadership and investment, with a clear mission as it operates at the bleeding edge of technology. Its goal is to scale and enhance the high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud infrastructure that supports its clients' research, production, and delivery, enabling breakthroughs that shape the industries of tomorrow. Its engineers build critical infrastructure to eliminate friction in scientific research, simulations, analysis, and decision-making, accelerating discovery and driving faster innovation.Engineering Intern ProgramThis is a 10-week, full-time summer internship based in Dallas, Texas, running from Monday, June 1st to Friday, August 7th, 2026.As an intern at NorthMark, you’ll join a high-performing team and work on impactful projects across areas such as software engineering, infrastructure automation, compute platforms, and network security. You'll contribute to production-level systems, collaborate with experienced engineers, and gain hands-on exposure to the tools and practices used in managing high-performance, scalable infrastructure.Interns are integrated into agile development workflows, participate in code reviews and technical discussions, and are given meaningful responsibilities with guidance and mentorship throughout the program.Learn more about the hiring teams below:Product & Solutions: Our product portfolio spans cloud platform services, particularly high-performance compute (HPC), as well as internal tools that enable the business to scale effectively. This internship is designed for students or early-career professionals who are considering a career in product management and want practical experience in shaping products that deliver real impact. You will work closely with experienced product managers, contributing to live projects while learning how to balance customer needs, technical feasibility and business priorities.HPC Network Engineering: In this role, you’ll contribute to the stability, scalability and performance of a highly available network environment that underpins complex research and compute workflows. You will gain exposure to industry-leading platforms (including Cisco and Arista technologies), while learning how we apply robust telemetry, observability and automation to ensure infrastructure resilience at scale. This is a hands-on opportunity to work with experienced network engineers in a collaborative environment that values curiosity, precision and continuous improvement.Computer Platform Management: This team is responsible for building and maintaining the systems that monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize the performance of our large-scale, high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. As part of the team, you will contribute to the development of telemetry and diagnostic tools that help ensure the reliability and efficiency of compute clusters comprising GPUs, CPUs and associated hardware. This internship offers hands-on experience in a live HPC production environment, working on hardware observability, telemetry data pipelines and infrastructure validation workflows.DevSecOps: Our DevSecOps team exists at the intersection of security, infrastructure and software engineering. It ensures secure development practices are embedded from the ground up. As a DevSecOps Security Engineering intern, you’ll work alongside engineers across the business to help improve how we detect, manage and reduce software security risks. You’ll contribute to making secure development seamless and intuitive, supporting automated security scanning, improving developer tooling and investigating real-world vulnerabilities in code and infrastructure. This internship offers practical, hands-on experience for students looking to build a career in cybersecurity, DevOps or secure software engineering.Fleet Automation: This team builds the internal automation services and applications that underpin how we manage our core technology platform – including compute, networking, storage and datacentre infrastructure. Our aim is to deliver scalable, reliable tools that reduce operational overhead and improve efficiency across the firm’s large-scale systems. As an intern, you will contribute to the development of these services, gaining hands-on experience with the technologies and practices used to manage modern, high-performance infrastructure platforms. You’ll work alongside experienced engineers on meaningful technical challenges and gain exposure to key concepts in systems automation and software engineering at scale.Application Infrastructure Tools: Our goal is to simplify and streamline internal development workflows through intuitive tools, automation and developer-friendly interfaces. We design and build full-stack solutions that support engineering efficiency and autonomy. As an intern, you’ll contribute to impactful features that improve the way engineers build and deliver software. Your work will span backend services and frontend user experiences – from refining APIs to designing thoughtful UI enhancements. You will collaborate with experienced engineers and engage with real user feedback to guide your development.Network Automation: Our Network Automation team is responsible for building the tools, services, and frameworks that enable scalable, reliable, and self-service networking across NMC²’s global infrastructure. As an intern, you will gain hands-on experience working on real-world automation projects that transform how our networks are deployed, operated, and observed. You will collaborate with experienced engineers to develop code, automation workflows, and CI/CD pipelines that directly impact how our research and compute environments operate at scale. This role offers a unique opportunity to combine networking fundamentals with software engineering practices, giving you exposure to the future of large-scale network operations.Generative AI: This team is responsible for developing and operating the core platforms that power every Generative AI initiative across our organization.From RAG services used company-wide to bespoke AI-powered automation systems, the team sits at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning and platform scalability. As an intern, you’ll work alongside engineers to design and build robust, ML-enabled systems that improve the operability and integration of our compute infrastructure.Platform Architecture: We are seeking a Platform Architecture Intern to support the design and documentation of the internal infrastructure, tooling and software development lifecycle (SDLC) processes that underpin our global platform operations. This role offers a hands-on introduction to core platform engineering concepts, including CI/CD pipelines, API gateways and observability, through a mix of prototyping, process evaluation and knowledge sharing.Observability: We are looking for an Observability Engineering Intern to join our Platform Observability team, which is responsible for building the systems that monitor the performance, health and reliability of our high-performance compute and cloud environments. As an intern, you’ll gain exposure to industry-leading observability tooling and telemetry practices while working alongside engineers to scale and enhance our platform’s monitoring capabilities.",
