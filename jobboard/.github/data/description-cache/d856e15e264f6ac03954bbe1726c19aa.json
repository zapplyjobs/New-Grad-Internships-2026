    "description": "Lightmatter is leading the revolution in AI data center infrastructure, enabling the next giant leaps in human progress. The company invented the world’s first 3D-stacked photonics engine, Passage™, capable of connecting thousands to millions of processors at the speed of light in extreme-scale data centers for the most advanced AI and HPC workloads. Lightmatter raised $400 million in its Series D round, reaching a valuation of $4.4 billion. We will continue to accelerate the development of data center photonics and grow every department at Lightmatter! If you're passionate about tackling complex challenges, making an impact, and being an expert in your craft, join our team of brilliant scientists, engineers, and accomplished industry leaders. Lightmatter is (re)inventing the future of computing with light!About the Role Lightmatter is seeking a PhD Intern to join our Machine Learning team. This internship offers a unique opportunity to contribute to the invention of novel hardware systems utilizing Lightmatter's cutting-edge technology and to model their performance on both training and inference workloads. This is a highly creative and impactful role where you'll be encouraged to think outside the box, pushing the boundaries of ML systems research by leveraging the power of silicon photonics. You'll work closely with our product, solutions architecture, and engineering teams, contributing to: Performance analysis of Lightmatter-enabled systems. The design of high-performance, rack-scale platforms. The generation of cutting-edge ML systems research. Responsibilities Research and stay current on the latest advancements in Machine Learning systems and models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). Develop and utilize tools to model the performance of Lightmatter-enabled systems running various training and inference workloads. Collaborate on the design of compelling reference platforms systems powered by Lightmatter technology. Work towards publishing academic papers at top industry conferences or journals, and assist in creating whitepapers, blog posts, and other technical collateral. Minimum Qualifications Currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or a closely related field.
