    "description": "About our group: The Advanced Data Storage Device Physics Group within the Seagate Research Group (SRG) is responsible for conducting research on advanced data storage and memory technologies through experimentation and physics-based simulation. The work performed by this team directly informs the Company's ten-year storage product roadmap.About the role - you will: ● Conduct research on advanced data storage systems through micromagnetic modeling, using atomistic or renormalized methods. ● Use proprietary or off-the-shelf micromagnetic software to investigate magnetic phenomena important to future magnetic data storage. ● Recording systems to be investigated may include HAMR (heat-assisted magnetic recording), optical interactions with magnetic recording media, and spin-torque assisted magnetic switching. ● Work closely with test engineers and data analysts in order to use models to explain experimentally observed phenomena.About you: ● Experience with programming languages (Python, Cuda, C++, Fortran, etc.) ● Familiar with the physics of magnetic materials, magnetism, spin transport, optical interactions with magnetic materials, and/or magnetic data storage ● Self-motivated and demonstrated ability to adapt to a changing environment and learn new technology ● Flexibility to operate under supervision and independently ● Excellent team player ● Excellent written and oral communication skills ● Experience with Linux-based computing hardware a plus.Your experience includes: ● A Ph.D. candidate in an engineering or scientific discipline and must be enrolled back at school for Fall 2026. Location: Our Normandale campus spans two suburbs, Edina and Bloomington, and serves as the Recording Head development and manufacturing arm of Seagate. Located in the heart of a bustling community, Seagate offers an on-site café, or if you prefer, you can drive to one of many restaurants just minutes away. Need to grab a gift over lunch time?
