Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like \"How do we evaluate wildfire risk and optimize a power grid as a result\" or \"How do we quickly assess our food supply chain and modify it to deliver life saving assistance on time?\" As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world.
