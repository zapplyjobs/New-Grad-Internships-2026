    "description": "About our group: The Advanced Data Storage Device Physics Group within the Seagate Research Group (SRG) is responsible for conducting research on advanced data storage and memory technologies through experimentation and physics-based simulation. The work performed by this team directly informs the Company's ten-year storage product roadmap.About the role - you will: ● Conduct research on advanced data storage systems using ferroelectric media. ● Help develop models to understand fundamental recording physics and dynamics of ferroelectric recording media. ● Use modeling to understand basic phenomena including switching characteristics, retention, and transducer requirement. ● Identify modeling activities and experiments to understand the physics of data storage in ferroelectrics. ● Work closely with test engineers and data analysts to use models to explain experimentally observed phenomena.About you: ● Experience with programming languages (Python, Cuda, C++, Fortran, etc.) ● Familiar with the physics of ferroelectric materials and models describing ferroelectric switching behavior, such as nucleation-limited switching, time-dependent Landau-Ginzberg models, and phase field models. ● Self-motivated and demonstrated ability to adapt to a changing environment and learn new technology ● Flexibility to operate under supervision and independently ● Excellent team player ● Excellent written and oral communication skills ● Experience with Linux-based computing hardware a plus.Your experience includes: ● A Ph.D. candidate in an engineering or scientific discipline and must be enrolled in school for Fall 2026. Location: Our Normandale campus spans two suburbs, Edina and Bloomington, and serves as the Recording Head development and manufacturing arm of Seagate. Located in the heart of a bustling community, Seagate offers an on-site café, or if you prefer, you can drive to one of many restaurants just minutes away. Need to grab a gift over lunch time? Shopping is abundant in the area. If working out is your thing, the on-site fully equipped fitness center hosts wellness programs, outdoor activities, tournaments and group workouts. Looking for something more laid back? Reset in one of our meditation rooms, or simply take a walk around our indoor walking path. On-site cultural festivals, celebrations and community volunteer opportunities also abound. #internship The estimated base wage range for this position is $22-$43/hr. The individual base wage is based on work location and additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training. Seagate offers comprehensive benefits to its eligible Interns, including, but not limited to, medical, dental, vision, and participation in the employee stock purchase plan. Seagate also offers Interns 12 paid holidays and a minimum of 48 hours of paid sick leave. The benefits for this position are based on a 24 to 40-hour-per-week schedule for a full calendar year and may differ depending on work location and tenure with the Company Location: Normandale, United States Travel: None",
