    "description": "By submitting your resume, you’re expressing interest in one of our 2026 Deep Learning Internships. We’ll review resumes on an ongoing basis, and a recruiter may reach out if your experience fits one of our many internship opportunities. NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to tackle challenges no one else can solve. Our work in AI and digital twins is transforming the world's largest industries and profoundly impacting society — from gaming to robotics, self-driving cars to life-saving healthcare, climate change to virtual worlds where we can all connect and create. Our internships offer an excellent opportunity to expand your career and get hands on experience with one of our industry leading Deep Learning teams. We’re seeking strategic, ambitious, hard-working, and creative individuals who are passionate about helping us tackle challenges no one else can solve. Throughout the 12-week full-time internship, students will work on projects that have a measurable impact on our business. We’re looking for students pursuing Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD degree within a relevant or related field. Potential Internships in this field include: Deep Learning Applications & Algorithms Developing algorithms for deep learning, data analytics, or scientific computing to improving performance of GPU implementations Course or internship experience related to the following areas could be required: Deep Neural Networks, Linear Algebra, Numerical Methods and/or Computer Vision, Software Design, Computer Memory (Disk, Memory, Caches), CPU and GPU Architectures, Networking, Numeric Libraries, Embedded System Design and Development, Drivers, Real-Time Software Deep Learning Frameworks & Libraries Building underlying frameworks and libraries to accelerate Deep Learning on GPUs Contributing directly to software packages such as JAX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, integrating the latest library (e.g., cuDNN) or CUDA features, performance tuning, and analysis Optimizing core deep learning algorithms and libraries (e.g., CuDNN, CuBLAS), maintaining build, test, and distribution infrastructure for these libraries and deep learning frameworks on NVIDIA supported platforms Course or internship experience related to the following areas could be required: Computer Architecture (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or other accelerators), GPU Programming Models, Performance-Oriented Parallel Programming, Optimizing for High-Performance Computing (HPC), Algorithms, Numerical Methods What we need to see: Must be actively enrolled in a university pursuing a Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or a related field, for the entire duration of the internship. Depending on the internship role, prior experience or knowledge requirements could include the following programming skills and technologies: C, C++, CUDA, Python, x86, ARM CPU, GPU, Linux, Direct3D, Vulkan, OpenGL, OpenCL, Spark, Perl, Bash/Shell Scripting, Container Tools (Docker/Containers, Kubernetes), Infrastructure Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), Data Technologies (Kafka, ELK, Cassandra, Apache Spark), React, Go Click here to learn more about NVIDIA, our early talent programs, benefits offered to students and other helpful student resources related to our latest technologies and endeavors. Our internship hourly rates are a standard pay based on the position, your location, year in school, degree, and experience. The hourly rate for our interns is 20 USD - 71 USD. You will also be eligible for Intern benefits. ​Applications are accepted on an ongoing basis.
