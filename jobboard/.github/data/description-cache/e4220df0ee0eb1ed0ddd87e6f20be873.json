    "description": "Onwards Together! Illumio is the leader in ransomware and breach containment, redefining how organizations contain cyberattacks and enable operational resilience. Powered by the Illumio AI Security Graph, our breach containment platform identifies and contains threats across hybrid multi-cloud environments – stopping the spread of attacks before they become disasters. Recognized as a Leader in the Forrester Wave™ for Microsegmentation, Illumio enables Zero Trust, strengthening cyber resilience for the infrastructure, systems, and organizations that keep the world running. This is a 12 week internship program beginning on May 26th 2026 or June 22nd 2026 Location: Onsite 5 day's a week at Headquarters in Sunnyvale, CA Our Team's Vision: Illumio’s Cloud Segmentation and Security Analytics team builds and operates the enforcement and analytics platform that stops lateral movement across multi-cloud and hybrid environments. We transform massive volumes of customer inventory, topology, and traffic data from AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI into actionable segmentation insights and precise policy enforcement. Our systems leverage native cloud security controls to achieve Zero Trust segmentation at scale. The team’s mission is to deliver real-time security analytics and enforcement orchestration that’s resilient, low-latency, and cloud-aware. We address the toughest challenges around scalability, rate limits, resiliency, and consistency across diverse cloud environments using a modern, distributed tech stack. What You'll Do: Design and build distributed services that analyze traffic and enforce segmentation policies across multi-cloud environments Develop scalable orchestration layers to translate and apply policies using native cloud firewalls and controls Build data pipelines that correlate cloud resources, traffic, topology, and network telemetry to derive real-time insights into trust boundaries and policy effectiveness Contribute to algorithms that contain lateral movement, policy drift, and misconfigurations. Optimize resiliency, latency, and throughput of enforcement workflows within cloud rate limit and API constraints Collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver secure, observable, and performant microservices Participate in design discussions, performance reviews, and production readiness assessments to ensure high reliability What You'll Bring: Currently enrolled in a full time Bachelor’s or Master’s degree program in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related field with an expected graduation date in Winter 2026/Spring 2027 A positive, can-do attitude with strong ownership and drive to build world-class cloud segmentation software Strong programming skills in Golang or similar language with solid understanding of distributed systems, data structures, and concurrency Familiarity with Kubernetes, gRPC, Postgres, graph databases, caching databases and public cloud platforms Interest in cloud security, firewall orchestration, and Zero Trust segmentation Understanding of networking concepts such as VPCs, routing, and firewall rule evaluation is a plus A mindset focused on scalability, fault tolerance, and performance optimization Strong collaboration, problem-solving, and communication skills What You'll Gain: Hands-on experience designing and deploying multi-cloud security and segmentation systems that operate at a massive scale Deep exposure to native cloud firewalls, enforcement points and policy APIs across AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI Understanding of how to operationalize Zero Trust principles using distributed enforcement models Mentorship from senior engineers building industry-leading cloud microsegmentation technology Opportunity to design and demo a capstone project with measurable impact on scalability, resiliency, or security posture Compensation: $ 37 - 47 USD Our Commitment: Illumio believes that an environment of unique backgrounds, experiences, viewpoints, and individual contributions drives our success and makes us stronger together.
