Design &amp; enhance the Notion platform with new capabilities, as and when the need arises. Design, develop, and own new product functionality and/or infrastructure leveraging modern frameworks and tooling. Develop, fix and debug software for web services, databases, applications, tools, networks. Qualifications: Pursuing a bachelor's or master’s degree in computer science, engineering, or another related field. Must graduate before July 2027. Previous internship experience. Working towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Typescript, Node.js, Go, Python, Java, Swift, Rust, or Kotlin. You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving them. You are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. This internship will take place from May - September (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time. Skills You’ll Need To Bring: Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck. For a backend internship: You have a passion for learning how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. Familiarity with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL is a plus. For a frontend internship: You have a passion for learning technologies (CSS, Javascript, &amp; React) and best practices in front-end architecture, including performance, accessibility and usability. Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go. Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same. Nice to Haves: You have expertise with specific technologies that are part of our stack, including Typescript, React, Electron, Node.js, AWS, and Postgres. You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work. You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences. Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger.
