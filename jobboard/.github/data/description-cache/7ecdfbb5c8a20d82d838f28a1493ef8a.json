    "description": "Lightmatter is leading the revolution in AI data center infrastructure, enabling the next giant leaps in human progress. The company invented the world’s first 3D-stacked photonics engine, Passage™, capable of connecting thousands to millions of processors at the speed of light in extreme-scale data centers for the most advanced AI and HPC workloads. Lightmatter raised $400 million in its Series D round, reaching a valuation of $4.4 billion. We will continue to accelerate the development of data center photonics and grow every department at Lightmatter! If you're passionate about tackling complex challenges, making an impact, and being an expert in your craft, join our team of brilliant scientists, engineers, and accomplished industry leaders. Lightmatter is (re)inventing the future of computing with light!Lightmatter is looking for an Electro-Optical Automation Intern to drive the efficiency and intelligence of our chip design process by developing robust automation scripts and integrating advanced machine learning techniques. This role involves optimizing complex electrical and optical simulation workflows and utilizing tools like Python, Cadence SKILL, and EDA/PDK environments to accelerate the design of cutting-edge electro-photonic systems. Key responsibilities: Develop Automation Scripts: Create robust, reusable scripts to automate the setup, execution, and data extraction of commercial electrical and optical simulation tools. Integrate Tools: Design and implement seamless workflows connecting various simulation tools and the overall design environment. Apply Machine Learning: Investigate and implement machine learning models (e.g., surrogate models, Bayesian optimization, or reinforcement learning) to efficiently navigate large design spaces and propose optimal chip architectures or device parameters. Optimize Performance: Identify bottlenecks in current simulation workflows and develop strategies to reduce simulation time and computational cost. Documentation: Clearly document all developed code, workflows, and machine learning methodologies. Qualifications: Current Enrollment: Currently pursuing a B.S. or M.S in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field. Programming Proficiency: Expert-level proficiency in Python for scripting, data analysis, and automation. EDA Scripting: Proven experience or strong willingness to learn and use Cadence SKILL programming for layout and simulation environment customization. Simulation Tools: Familiarity with commercial EDA (Electronic Design Automation) and PDK (Photonic Design Kit) simulation tools (e.g., ADS, Cadence Spectre/Virtuoso). Machine Learning Fundamentals: A solid foundation in machine learning concepts, including model training, validation, and practical experience with relevant libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch). Experience with version control systems (e.g., Git). Preferred: Currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field. Prior experience with electrical integrated circuit (EIC) and/or photonic integrated circuit (PIC) Familiarity with cloud computing environments for running large-scale simulations. Familiarity with with Signal integrity and power integrity simulation tools such as Cadence Sigrity, ANSYS HFSS/SIWave and IDEM Our internship hourly rates are a standard pay determined based on the position and your location, year in school, degree, and experience.Hourly Rate in USD$43 - $57 USDBenefits Comprehensive Health Care Plan (Medical, Dental & Vision) Retirement Savings Matching Program Life Insurance (Basic, Voluntary & AD&D) Generous Time Off (Vacation, Sick & Public Holidays) Paid Family Leave Short Term & Long Term Disability Training & Development Commuter Benefits Flexible, hybrid workplace model Equity grants (applicable to full-time employees) Benefits eligibility may vary depending on your employment status and location.
