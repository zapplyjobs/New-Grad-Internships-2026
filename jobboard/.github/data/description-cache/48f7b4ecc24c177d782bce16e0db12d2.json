By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.The RoleAs a Deployment Strategist Intern, you'll work as part of a diverse, generative, and creative team of Engineers, Product Designers, and other Deployment Strategists to deploy software against the most important problems our world faces. Your mission is to synthesize disconnected streams of thought into a cohesive understanding of what the problem is, what the data means, what the product needs, what users are motivated by, and where the impact could be. The problems you'll solve will require a curious and analytical mindset, a sharp intuition for product, an ability to speak the language of data, and an understanding that humans should make decisions.At its core, this role is about uncovering dots and—without knowing the shape they form—figuring out how to connect them. Our customers come to us with a hunch that the only way to protect their troops, manufacture high-quality products, structure effective healthcare policies, or deliver aid to refugees safely is to make better use of their data. Deployment Strategists are responsible for turning that hunch into reality.Deployment Strategists are do-ers who thrive in ambiguity, react quickly to new stimuli, and don't equate pivoting with failing as they operate in pursuit of truth, value, and meaningful impact. In this internship, you'll immerse yourself in intricate customer workflows, explore data using quantitative analytics across large datasets, and dive into the product landscape.If you believe in the transformational power of data and technology and in your own ability to bring that power to bear against complex problems, we want to meet you.No two days are the same, but as a Deployment Strategist you can expect to:Go onsite and meet with customer analysts to understand the critical questions they need to answer and locate their biggest struggles.Build a case for gaining access to the relevant datasets, and work with Forward Deployed Engineers to integrate the data into a stable and extensible pipeline.
