Our mission is BIG.Our TRANSFORMATION is key – bringing the right businesses together to LEAD the ENERGY TRANSITION. Our TEAM is ready.Addressing the climate crisis is an urgent global priority and we take our responsibility seriously. Building on over 130 years of experience tackling the world’s challenges, GE Vernova is uniquely positioned to help lead the energy transition by continuing to electrify the world while simultaneously working to decarbonize it. GE Vernova helps customers power economies and deliver electricity that is vital to health, safety, security, and improved quality of life.Job DescriptionReimagine gas turbine design with Amp, GE Vernova’s LLM, as your co-engineer for design related tools. As part of STAI, you’ll link natural-language agents to physics-based tools (CFD, heat transfer, optimization, mechanical design) via APIs/MCPs, turning complex workflows into conversational, reproducible pipelines. You’ll deliver a working POC, beta-test with global users, and demo results to Chief Engineers and leadership—advancing cleaner, more flexible power while learning from domain experts. Collaborate with fellow interns and STAI engineers, blend AI/ML with physics modeling, and leave with a portfolio-ready project that sets a strong foundation for scaled adoption across Gas Power.Project Outcomes:• Deliver a working proof-of-concept (POC) that connects Amp to selected physics-based gas turbine tools via APIs / MCPs, enabling natural-language control and agent based task execution across CFD, heat transfer, optimization, and mechanical design workflows.• Beta test the proof-of-concept with user communities; collect feedback and iterate for robustness and usability.• Collaborate closely with System Technologies and Adaptive Intelligence (STAI) engineers - Gas Power's New Technology R&D team, and fellow MIT interns; conduct progress demos and final report-outs to leadership and/or Chief Engineers.• Produce clear documentation (architecture, interfaces, usage) for downstream teams; recommend next steps toward operationalization.• Apply Lean/Agile/Six Sigma concepts to deliver on time and align with STAI’s vision and charters.Primary Skills Developed:• LLM/agent design for engineering workflows using Amp; prompt strategies and orchestration patterns.• API/MCP integration with commercial and/or in-house physics-based tools; multi-tool pipeline automation.• Practical experience with CFD / heat transfer / optimization / mechanical design workflows and how AI augments them.• Systems thinking that fuses physics based modeling with AI/ML and data management for engineering impact.• Lean, Agile, and/or Six Sigma application in an R&D setting; beta testing and user-feedback loops.• Executive communication: storytelling with technical demos; report outs to leadership / Chief Engineers.• Cross-functional teamwork within a global engineering organization.Basic Qualifications:• Currently pursuing a Masters degree in engineering or computer science by the start of the internship.• Minimum GPA of 4.0/5.0.• 6 months or more of relevant co-op, internship, or work experience.Desired Qualifications:• Understanding of physics-based engineering tools and/or computer science / LLMs sufficient to contribute to integrating Amp with design tools.• Ability to work effectively in a team with MIT students and GE Vernova STAI engineers and user communities around the world.• Willingness to present progress and outcomes to leadership and/or Chief Engineers.• Experience with / knowledge of gas turbine or turbomachinery design environments and/or physics-based tools (CFD, heat transfer, modeling, optimization), whether commercial or in-house.• Experience building NL interfaces, AI agents, or tool integrations via APIs or MCPs.• Demonstrated learning agility and ability to bring clarity to nebulous, cross-disciplinary problems with measurable impact.• Familiarity with Lean, Six Sigma, and/or Agile principles.• Strong problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills; comfortable interfacing across levels and geographies.• Change-agent mindset with bias for early adoption and process improvement.• Strong technical, business, financial analysis skills, and interpersonal skills to work in a team environment.Benefits Available to you: Addressing the climate crisis is an urgent global priority, and at GE Vernova, we take our responsibility seriously.
