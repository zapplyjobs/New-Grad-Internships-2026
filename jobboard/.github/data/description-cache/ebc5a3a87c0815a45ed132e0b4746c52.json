    "description": "Relay, a dynamic and rapidly growing tech startup based in Raleigh, is on a mission to revolutionize frontline work. For decades, technology has supercharged the desk worker while leaving behind the 80% of the global workforce who don’t sit at a desk. The builders, the caregivers, the operators, the movers—the frontline—still rely on walkie-talkies, paper notes, and shouted instructions. At Relay, we believe it’s time for a change. Our smart, rugged radios and connected cloud ecosystem harness the power of voice and AI to close this digital chasm. We’re building tools that meet frontline workers where they are, capturing tribal knowledge, and turning communication into action. By transforming every spoken word into intelligence, we’re delivering safety, productivity, and empowerment to the workers who keep our world moving. We are looking for a motivated and ambitious undergraduate student expected to graduate in December 2026 or Spring 2027 to join our Engineering team for a paid Internship during your current Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 semesters. High-performing interns may have the opportunity to extend their internship in consideration for a Summer 2026 internship, and will be considered for potential full-time roles after graduation, depending on business needs. Take a look at our website at relaypro.com Job Overview This internship offers a chance to build technology that matters—products that directly empower frontline workers. You’ll collaborate with engineers in a high-growth environment, helping to develop tools that turn voice into structured data, integrate AI into workflows, and make communication instantly actionable. Interns will gain hands-on experience across the engineering stack, from core product functionality to tools that accelerate development to AI-powered experiences that put intelligence directly into the hands (and voices) of frontline teams. The internship will be based at our Raleigh, NC headquarters and is in-office. Summer interns are expected to work full-time in-office during the summer in our amenity rich, world class headquarters in Raleigh, NC. We use a diverse set of languages, including Erlang, Java, Javascript, and some Python. Our systems are generally Linux-based. Our culture is based on Impact, Team, and Learning. What You Will Do Work in close coordination with other engineers to contribute to product functionality, enablement tools, and issue resolution. Analyze requirements to determine feasibility, propose architectures, assess risk, and estimate effort. Participate in the team’s software development process and tooling, gaining real-world Agile experience and getting code into production. Develop automated tests to ensure quality, reliability, and performance. Research and share best practices in software development, including AI/ML applications, to continuously raise the bar for the team.
