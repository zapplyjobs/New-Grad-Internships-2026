    "description": "About Us Reframe Systems is on a mission to build net-zero carbon housing for all, at massive scale. To achieve our mission, we need to make net-zero carbon housing more affordable and we are re-imagining how housing is designed and built. Our modular building platform and highly-automated production system will drive down cost, delivery time, and embodied carbon for ADUs and multifamily housing. We are setting up our first software driven factory in the greater Boston area (Andover, MA), and have a roadmap to scale our presence nationally. We are disrupting assembly line manufacturing for housing production and are backed by leading VC firms in the industrial and construction space. What We're Looking For We are looking for a robotics software engineer intern or co-op to help us design and build a re-imagined, carbon conscious, highly-automated, offsite construction micro-factory. The ideal candidate has passion for programming as a tool to solve real-world problems. Candidates with prior experience in robotics or embedded-systems are preferred (academic or otherwise), and all candidates with software experience and a passion to learn will be considered. Candidates should be eager to collaborate with a multi-disciplinary team of industry-veteran roboticists, architects and engineers to tackle hard-problems, designing, prototyping, and testing new manipulation workcells and mobility solutions. Responsibilities Contribute to the design, development, and maintenance of software for robotic manipulation workcells. Work alongside senior engineers in planning, execution, and analysis of development projects. Gain exposure to real-world software development in a dynamic, fast-paced environment. Collaborate in the design of robotic software components for automated micro-factories. Learn and contribute to the implementation of vision-based algorithms, motion planning problems, physics-based simulation and parametric workflows. Explore and support capabilities in both production and development environments. Assist in validating hypotheses through data-driven experimentation. Document and summarize findings, presenting them to the team for collaborative discussion. Contribute to the execution of new ideas, taking them from proof-of-concept to operational stages. Basic Qualifications Currently pursuing a degree in Robotics, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related STEM discipline. Solid programming skills, with a preference for proficiency in C++, Python, and ROS 2. Proficiency using Git and operating in a Linux environment. Bonus points for experience in developing with Docker and cloud services (AWS). Previous experiences in a professional software development environment, developing open-source software, etc. are a plus. Strong passion for developing software for robotics other multi-disciplinary environments. Past involvement in a professional software development setting, including the development of open-source software, is advantageous. Strong passion for developing software for robotics other multi-disciplinary environments. is highly valued. Including exposure to robotic simulators and a background in simulation-first development. Self-motivated with the ability to independently solve problems. Strong communication skills and the capacity to collaborate effectively within a team.",
