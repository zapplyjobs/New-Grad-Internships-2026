    "description": "Job Description SummaryJob DescriptionJoin our AI research team to help create the intelligent electric grid of the future. As an AI Research Intern, you will focus on one of the most critical challenges in the energy transition: ensuring a stable, efficient, and resilient power grid. Your primary objective will be to develop and demonstrate advanced machine learning models for large-scale grid optimization and forecasting.This project goes beyond traditional data-driven approaches. A key component of your work will be to integrate fundamental physics and domain knowledge—such as grid topology, power flow equations, and operational constraints—into your machine learning models. You will explore hybrid AI techniques to create practical, accurate, and robust solutions. Your work will have impact in improving grid operations, enabling higher penetration of renewable energy, and enhancing overall system reliability.• Comprehensive Energy Analysis & Technical Report: A detailed technical report and final presentation analyzing the trade-offs between efficiency and model accuracy and providing recommendations for best practices.• Validated Codebase: Well-documented, reusable code implementing the energy-efficient techniques (e.g., model compression, efficient training algorithms), contributed to the team’s repository.• Potential Contribution to the Field: Novel research findings that could form the basis of a patent application or a publication in AI conference/workshop focused on efficient AI.• Applied Research & Development Lifecycle: Practical experience of the end-to-end research process in an industrial setting—from problem formulation and experimental design to prototyping, rigorous validation, and results analysis.• Technical Communication & Documentation: Advanced skills in documenting code, articulating complex technical trade-offs in reports, and presenting research findings to a team of experts and business stakeholders.Basic Qualifications:• Currently pursuing a M.S./Ph.D. in Computer Science or related fields in MIT School of Engineering (EECS, MechE, etc.), Schwarzman College of Computing, or School of Science (Mathematics)• Legal authorization to work in the U.S. is required.• Must be willing to work out of an office located in Niskayuna, NY. • Minimum GPA 4.0 / 5.0 scale.• Because of the specific categories of data handled by GE Vernova Advanced Research and the structure of our work environment, we are unable to accommodate employment of persons while they are considered nationals of countries subject to comprehensive restrictions under the US Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR Section 746 et seq.
