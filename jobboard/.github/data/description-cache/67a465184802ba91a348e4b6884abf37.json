    "description": "Job Description Summary:This opportunity is open ONLY to undergraduates enrolled in a degree-seeking program at a U.S. university or college. The NESSI program cannot accommodate students who are attending schools on a quarterly schedule. The NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Education, Engagement, and Early Career Development (EdEC) seeks undergraduate Earth System Science students to participate as interns in the 2026 NSF NCAR Earth System Science Internship (NESSI). The 2026 NESSI will run for 11 weeks, from May 18 - July 31, 2026.Interns collaborate with NSF NCAR scientists and engineers on research across any NSF NCAR laboratories, exploring a wide range of topics in Earth system science, such as atmospheric science, computational science, engineering, and solar and space physics. Beyond the core geosciences, NSF NCAR’s interdisciplinary mission encourages the integration of various fields to address complex challenges in climate, weather, and related Earth system disciplines. As a result, there are also valuable opportunities for projects in data science, social science, and science education. Each research project is shaped by the student’s interests and the availability of an NSF NCAR mentor working in a related field or topic.Position Details: Visa Sponsored Job:NoRelocation Assistance Eligible:NoJob Location: Boulder, ColoradoPosition Type & Term:Full time, Term - less than 6 months (Fixed Term)Compensation Min - Mid Range:Hourly Rate: $23.41Application NotesTo know more about the Internship and the Application requirements, please visit this website: https://edec.ucar.edu/students/nessiJob Location: Boulder, COJob Type: In Person (Interns are required to be on-site for the entire duration of the Internship)The Internship duration is 11 weeks, from May 18 to July 31, 2026Visa sponsorship is NOT available for this position.Relocation Assistance is NOT available for this position.Application Deadline: January 4, 2026.Required application materials:Please review our AI Usage guidelines here before submitting your application material:1.

What You Will DoHere is a brief summary of what one would expect to be generally responsible for in this role.Key Responsibilities:Research: Interns work with NSF NCAR scientists to conduct research in any NSF NCAR lab(s) on a wide range of topics, including atmospheric science, computational science, engineering, and solar & space physics. In addition to research in core geosciences, NSF NCAR has a strong interdisciplinary mission to apply knowledge from other fields to address significant issues in climate, weather, and related disciplines. Thus, there is also a significant opportunity for data science, social science, and science education projects. Research projects should be defined by the student's interest and the ability to pair them with a mentor working in a similar field or topic.Reports and Presentations: At the conclusion of the summer program, each intern prepares an oral and poster presentation of their work to be presented either in person or virtually to scientists, staff, and peers. Community and Professional Behavior: NESSI interns work together and are part of a larger community of UCAR and NSF NCAR summer interns. NESSI interns will conduct themselves in an appropriate and professional manner, adhering to UCAR’s Code of Conduct. Interns are expected to participate during regular office hours, when NESSI functions fully, and while traveling for the internship.Who We'd Love To Join Our TeamSuccessful candidates will ensure their application materials speak to the following criteria: Education and Experience REQUIRED:MUST be currently enrolled as an undergraduate student in sophomore year or above (no Freshman) in an accredited US university or college with a major/concentration in any of the following disciplines:Earth System ScienceAtmospheric ScienceComputer Science Social ScienceEngineering PhysicsMathematicsGeographyMust be a Sophomore or above (Candidates should have completed the equivalent of at least one year of college, no Freshman/first-year) Education & Experience Desired but Not Required:Have some basic research and programming experience and have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher (on a 5.0 scale)Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities REQUIRED:Ability to work on-site, full-time (40 hours per week) during the entire 11-week summer programBasic knowledge, through coursework, of Earth system science conceptsGood problem-solving skillsAbility and willingness to learn and use scientific computing tools and programsAbility to work with a variety of staff membersGood oral and written communication skillsAbility to interact with mentors and peers in a manner that supports collaboration and inquiryWorking knowledge of essential office and communication software (e.g., G Suite, email clients)Ability and willingness to work within the guidelines and policies of the organization and assigned workgroups Commitment to Job Application FairnessApplicants are not required to provide age or age-related information and may redact information related to age, date of birth, or dates of attendance at or graduation from an educational institution from any submissions during the initial application process.Some Final ConsiderationsAt NSF NCAR| UCAR | UCP, you will work alongside a dedicated team of professionals conducting critical research and community outreach to solve complex Earth system science problems including climate change, air pollution, extreme weather, floods, drought, wildfires, and space weather, all with the goal of improving human life and reducing economic loss.
