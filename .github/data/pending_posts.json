As part of the Clean Water Act (CWA), WPP monitors, assesses, and publishes reports on the conditions of all surface waters in the Commonwealth every two years in the %22Integrated List of Waters%22 (or Integrated Reports) and the 303(d) list.%3Co:p%3E%3C/o:p%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/p%3E%3Cp class=%22MsoNormal%22 style=%22line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0in;%22%3E%3Cspan style=%22font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14px;%22%3E%3Co:p%3E %3C/o:p%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/p%3E%3Cp class=%22MsoNormal%22 style=%22line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0in;%22%3E%26nbsp;%3C/p%3E%3Cp class=%22MsoNormal%22 style=%22line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0in;%22%3E%3Cspan style=%22font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14px;%22%3EThe waters of the Commonwealth include over 3,000 lakes and ponds that provide residents and visitors with drinking water, blue spaces, recreational opportunities, and natural beauty. These diverse ecosystems range from large drinking water sources, like the Quabbin; famous waterbodies, like Walden Pond; pristine lakes and ponds in fully forested areas; and smaller ponds providing local swimming areas. Given the importance of lakes and ponds for all people in the Commonwealth, WPP is interested in developing a lake and pond database to support current and future WPP initiatives, such as developing a statewide volunteer lake and pond monitoring program, implementing lake and pond categories to improve the assessment of the Aquatic Life Use in accordance to the Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards, highlighting areas in need of future monitoring, and prioritizing the development of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs).%3Co:p%3E%3C/o:p%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/p%3E%3Cp class=%22MsoNormal%22 style=%22line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0in;%22%3E%3Cspan style=%22font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14px;%22%3E%3Co:p%3E %3C/o:p%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/p%3E%3Cp class=%22MsoNormal%22 style=%22line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0in;%22%3E%26nbsp;%3C/p%3E%3Cp class=%22MsoNormal%22 style=%22line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0in;%22%3E%3Cspan style=%22font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14px;%22%3EThis project will create a reference database of lakes and ponds that can be expanded and maintained in the future as additional information is gathered.

As part of the Clean Water Act (CWA), WPP monitors, assesses, and publishes reports on the conditions of all surface waters in the Commonwealth every two years in the %22Integrated List of Waters%22 (or Integrated Reports) and the 303(d) list.%3Co:p%3E%3C/o:p%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/p%3E%3Cp class=%22MsoNormal%22 style=%22line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0in;%22%3E%3Cspan style=%22font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14px;%22%3E%3Co:p%3E %3C/o:p%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/p%3E%3Cp class=%22MsoNormal%22 style=%22line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0in;%22%3E%26nbsp;%3C/p%3E%3Cp class=%22MsoNormal%22 style=%22line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0in;%22%3E%3Cspan style=%22font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14px;%22%3EThe waters of the Commonwealth include over 3,000 lakes and ponds that provide residents and visitors with drinking water, blue spaces, recreational opportunities, and natural beauty. These diverse ecosystems range from large drinking water sources, like the Quabbin; famous waterbodies, like Walden Pond; pristine lakes and ponds in fully forested areas; and smaller ponds providing local swimming areas. Given the importance of lakes and ponds for all people in the Commonwealth, WPP is interested in developing a lake and pond database to support current and future WPP initiatives, such as developing a statewide volunteer lake and pond monitoring program, implementing lake and pond categories to improve the assessment of the Aquatic Life Use in accordance to the Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards, highlighting areas in need of future monitoring, and prioritizing the development of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs).%3Co:p%3E%3C/o:p%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/p%3E%3Cp class=%22MsoNormal%22 style=%22line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0in;%22%3E%3Cspan style=%22font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14px;%22%3E%3Co:p%3E %3C/o:p%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/p%3E%3Cp class=%22MsoNormal%22 style=%22line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0in;%22%3E%26nbsp;%3C/p%3E%3Cp class=%22MsoNormal%22 style=%22line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0in;%22%3E%3Cspan style=%22font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14px;%22%3EThis project will create a reference database of lakes and ponds that can be expanded and maintained in the future as additional information is gathered.

%3C/span%3EProject objectives are to (1) determine all lakes and ponds in the Commonwealth using existing spatial and modeled data (e.g., NHDPlus), (2) coalesce existing WPP data (e.g., years

modeled data and, where applicable, compare modeled data to WPP observed data (e.g., modeled maximum depth compared to observed), and, (5) if time allows, summarize existing spatial data (e.g., LakeCat or calculating surrounding land use).%3Co:p%3E%3C/o:p%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/p%3E%3Cp class=%22MsoNormal%22 style=%22line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0in;%22%3E%3Cspan style=%22font-family:Arial,
