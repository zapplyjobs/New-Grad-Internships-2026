    "job_description": "Product Intern, SoftwareSan Francisco, CAProduct – Product /Intern /On-siteApply for this jobAbout Lumafield: Lumafield was founded in 2019 to upgrade manufacturing. We are engineers with deep experience across the product development cycle, from initial ideas to shipping hardware, across industries and specializations, who became frustrated by the cost and complexity of modern manufacturing. So we decided to upgrade it. Engineers make million-dollar decisions every day, and they need tools that give them the greatest possible insight into their products. By offering unprecedented visibility into products, as well as AI-driven tools that highlight problems and generate quantitative data, Lumafield promises to revolutionize the way complex products are created, manufactured, and used across industries. We started with industrial CT scanning, which for us was the most valuable but underutilized tool in the manufacturing toolbox, enabling us to rapidly inspect essential components non-destructively. We rebuilt the whole system, from X-ray capture, to computer vision analysis, to web-based collaboration, to the entire business model, making the most advanced manufacturing tech more accessible to every industry. Our company, like our platform, is designed for upgrades. We’re building for greater intelligence, autonomy, and speed. For deeper vision, operational excellence, and powerful insights. And then we'll upgrade it all again. Lumafield is headquartered in Cambridge, MA, and has an office in San Francisco, CA.About the role: The Product Engineering Intern will join Lumafield’s Product team to prototype and ship experimental software that brings 3D data to life. You’ll build full-stack web applications and interactive visualizations that help engineers and designers interact with complex volumetric data, explore new product ideas, and shape the next generation of Lumafield’s user experience.This is a hands-on, creative internship for a “vibe coder” — someone who codes not just to make things work, but to make them feel right. You’ll work in a rapid prototyping environment where curiosity, polish, and playfulness matter as much as technical skill.Ideal for a junior or senior year student studying computer science, applied mathematics, design engineering, or a related field who’s excited by the intersection of data, design, and storytelling.What you'll do: Prototype and ship interactive web applications for scientific and 3D data visualization.Build internal tools and dashboards that accelerate development, analysis, and customer insight.Collaborate with designers and engineers to bring data to life through expressive UI and intuitive interactivity.Integrate AI-assisted tools to speed up development and experimentation.Curate and visualize test datasets to support algorithm benchmarking and user testing.Explore and experiment with graphics, rendering, and WebGL/WebGPU frameworks to make scientific data accessible and delightful.About you: You are a product-minded engineer with a strong sense of aesthetic and user empathyYou’ve built and deployed full-stack apps (React, Next.js, Node, Python/FastAPI, or similar)You’re comfortable with modern web visualization frameworks (Three.js, D3.js, Deck.gl, Plotly, etc.)You use AI tools as creative amplifiers, not just productivity hacksYou can communicate visually — through code, mockups, or sketchesYou prioritize speed and learning over polish when prototypingYou’re curious, playful, and obsessed with how things look and feelBonus points for: A portfolio or GitHub showcasing interactive or creative coding projects.Experience with 3D rendering, scientific visualization, or computational geometry.Familiarity with data-driven storytelling or creative coding tools (Processing, p5.js, TouchDesigner, etc.)Experience working with scientific or physical datasets (e.g. simulation, imaging, or CAD)A genuine interest in the intersection of science, design, and technology.$30 - $36 an hourThis role will be performed alongside a cohort of Lumafield summer interns and is a paid position. We also offer relocation assistance if you are out-of-state. We do not currently offer visa sponsorship or OPT eligibility.

Do you feel like your skills don’t meet every single requirement listed? We encourage you to apply anyway – If you’re excited about our technology, the opportunity, and are eager to learn more we’d love to hear from you!
