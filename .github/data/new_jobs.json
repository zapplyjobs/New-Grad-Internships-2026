NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to tackle challenges no one else can solve. Our work in AI and digital twins is transforming the world's largest industries and profoundly impacting society — from gaming to robotics, self-driving cars to life-saving healthcare, climate change to virtual worlds where we can all connect and create. Our internships offer an excellent opportunity to expand your career and get hands on experience with one of our industry leading Graphics and Simulation teams. We’re seeking strategic, ambitious, hard-working, and creative individuals who are passionate about helping us tackle challenges no one else can solve. Learn more about Research at NVIDIA. What you will be doing: Design and develop algorithms, hardware, and software that advance the state of the art in computing, graphics, media processing, and other technologies central to NVIDIA’s business. Invent new techniques, technologies, methodologies, processes, and devices, to enable new products or types of products. Deliverable results may include prototypes, patents, leading to products and publications. Collaborate with other team members, teams, and/or external researchers. What we need to see: Must be actively enrolled in a university pursuing a PhD degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or a related field, for the entire duration of the internship. Depending on the internship, prior experience or knowledge requirements could include the following programming skills and technologies: Python, C, CUDA, HLSL/GLSL, ML Frameworks (PyTorch, JAX, Warp) Strong background in research with publications at top conferences. Excellent communication and collaboration skills. Experience with large-scale model training is a plus. Potential internships require research experience in at least one of the following areas: Real-Time Graphics and Rendering Differentiable Rendering Ray Tracing and Path Tracing Neural Rendering Models Light Transport and Material/Shape Modeling Simulation and Animation Physics-based simulation World models Deep learning for animation 3D and 4D Content Creation Virtual and augmented reality environments Generative AI for graphics, simulation, and content creation 3D Deep Learning Digital human creation Human motion modeling GPU-accelerated algorithms and systems for graphics and simulation Synthetic data generation Click here to learn more about NVIDIA, our early talent programs, benefits offered to students and other helpful student resources related to our latest technologies and endeavors. Our internship hourly rates are a standard pay based on the position, your location, year in school, degree, and experience. The hourly rate for our interns is 30 USD - 94 USD. You will also be eligible for Intern benefits. ​Applications are accepted on an ongoing basis. NVIDIA is committed to fostering a diverse work environment and proud to be an equal opportunity employer. As we highly value diversity in our current and future employees, we do not discriminate (including in our hiring and promotion practices) on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status or any other characteristic protected by law.",
