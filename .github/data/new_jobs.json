    "job_city": "Seattle",
    "job_state": "WA",
    "job_description": "Persons in these roles are expected to work from our offices in Seattle. On-site requirements vary based on position and team. If you have questions about on-site work arrangements for this role, please ask your recruiter. *Compensation dependent on current degree enrollment. Research Intern, Undergrad: $94,320 (Annually) Research Intern, Masters: $106,110 (Annually) Research Intern, PhD: $140,000 (Annually) Who You Are: Ai2 is seeking passionate, early-career researchers to join us for full-time research internships with us. Applicants should have a demonstrated interest in advancing the state of the art in large language model (LLM) based agents and associated environments. International candidates are welcome to apply. Pay is competitive, and visa sponsorship is available. Ai2 Research Internship Information: Duration: 12 weeks Start date: Flexible Candidates: A PhD candidate or a master/undergraduate student with a strong research background. Please apply by December 15, 2025 at 11:00pm Pacific Time to be considered for our Spring/Summer 2026 internships. Who We Are: At Ai2, we are excited about developing large language models that can autonomously act in real-world environments to accomplish user goals. We are building frontier open agentic LLMs — models that can plan, reason, use tools and APIs, write code, and interact with complex, dynamic environments to solve long-horizon tasks safely and reliably. This work is part of Ai2’s broader mission to make AI systems more capable, trustworthy, and beneficial to science and society, while also openly releasing artifacts and effective procedures to build such systems. We are seeking ambitious, motivated interns to join a research effort focused on advancing the science of training and evaluating general purpose agentic models. Our work systematically explores how data synthesis, training objectives, and learning environments shape the emergence of generalizable and reliable agentic behavior, and how such behavior can be measured in a meaningful and reproducible manner. You will be part of a team investigating fundamental questions in this space, such as: What data, training strategies, and environments yield models that generalize across diverse agentic tasks? Can we design challenging benchmarks and environments that capture complex multi-step tool use and other underexplored aspects of agentic behavior? How should models interleave thinking and tool use? Can they learn to reason efficiently while deciding when and how to act? How can external memory help models tackle long-horizon reasoning and planning? How can we train models to be safe, reliable, and controllable when used for agentic tasks? Can we develop a theoretical understanding of agentic abilities and limits of LLMs and use it to guide agent development? Your Next Challenge: At Ai2, you will be working with world-class AI researchers and talented software engineers, who perform team-based, ambitious research, with a mandate to strive for big breakthroughs, not just incremental progress, in an exciting and interactive workplace. We encourage open collaborations and support students freely publishing papers based on their internship work. As an Ai2 Research Intern, you will: be paired with a mentor and will participate directly in Ai2's groundbreaking work, including building state-of-the-art AI systems, developing challenging benchmarks, and conducting extensive experiments; have access to Ai2’s compute resources, using our clusters of A100s and H100s; and have the opportunity to contribute to our larger projects such as OLMo and Asta. To see more about our current, future, and past interns, check out the internship page on our website! What You’ll Need: Be pursuing PhD (or, in exceptional cases, MS or BS) in computer science or a related field. Have an interest in cutting-edge artificial intelligence research, in particular in building, evaluating, and understanding LLM based agents. Physical Demands and Work Environment: The physical demands described here are representative of those that must be met by an employee to successfully perform the essential functions of this position. Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the functions. Must be able to remain in a stationary position for long periods of time.

As a full stack intern on the DFR team, you will help build workflows that span across the stack to enable responders to focus on what matters most. The DFR team spans the whole Skydio Cloud stack, from React and Relay for live operations and map‑centric UIs to backend services for incident workflows and integrations with public safety systems like CAD (computer aided dispatch) and evidence management platforms. We build in TypeScript on the frontend and collaborate closely with backend services (commonly Go and Python). As an intern, you’ll gain hands-on experience across the stack, collaborating with engineers, designers, and product managers to deliver meaningful features and learn what it takes to ship production software. How you’ll make an impact Design and implement operator-facing features that help first responders coordinate incidents and make faster, safer decisions. Leverage curiosity, technical skill, and a collaborative mindset to help make the world more productive, creative, and safe with autonomous drones. Collaborate across functions (product managers, designers, engineers, and support) to deliver high‑quality, impactful features to customers. Project examples Build operator‑facing features used daily in Drone as First Responder (DFR) to enhance existing capabilities and enable new workflows on Skydio Cloud. Create real‑time UI for live video and relaying telemetry data from the drone. Implement map‑centric interactions for placing and managing incident markers (911 calls) with clear affordances and undo/redo. Ship pre‑merge end‑to‑end tests for critical user journeys to prevent regressions and increase release confidence. What makes you a good fit Solid software engineering foundation and a commitment to writing clean, well‑architected code. Junior, senior, or MS-level student with meaningful project or internship experience developing modern web applications that connect to backend APIs and data systems. Enthusiasm for learning new technologies and collaborating within a fast‑paced team environment. Experience in modern web development (React, TypeScript, GraphQL, WebGL/Three.js). Experience building and maintaining scalable APIs, services, and integrations for handling large datasets. Bonus: familiarity with robotics software development concepts. Compensation Range: The hourly rate for this position is $47/hr for Undergrad, $53/hr for Graduate students, and $58 for PhD students*. Compensation will vary based on factors, including skill level, proficiencies, transferable knowledge, and experience. *For some positions the pay may be dependent upon the individual's regional location. #LI-ZD1At Skydio we believe that diversity drives innovation.
