Video encoding aims to reduce the data size, allowing files to be easily transferred between locations. However, it introduces undesirable artifacts at mid and low bitrates. The use of ML models alongside traditional signal processing approaches can improve their quality. The goal of the project is to curate a content database and leverage it to obtain production-ready ML models that enhance non-pristine input content so that it can be promptly used on the received sources before the encoding pipeline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who Are You?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently pursuing a PhD in a technical field such as Computer Science, Engineering, Math, or Statistics, graduating in December 2026, Summer 2027 or later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To be intern-eligible, you must be returning to school for one semester or quarter post-Summer internship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thrives working in complex, dynamic, and fast-moving environments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Articulate communicator across written and verbal communication mediums.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Strong software development skills and feels comfortable with software engineering best practices (e.g., version control, testing, code review, etc.).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Successful track record in Machine Learning, Video Algorithms, Video Coding research, or adjacent fields (Video Processing, Computer Vision, Video Quality).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Solid understanding of machine learning and deep learning concepts, hands-on experience with training and evaluating ML models &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Able to program fluently in Python and C/C&amp;#43;&amp;#43;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bonus points:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Solid understanding of video compression and processing, including codec standards such as HEVC and AV1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experience with software performance optimization on constrained hardware.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Involvement in open-source multimedia projects (ffmpeg, etc).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experience with large-scale distributed systems and cloud computing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about our team, check out the following articles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://research.netflix.com/research-area/video-encoding-and-quality&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://research.netflix.com/research-area/video-encoding-and-quality&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Internships at Netflix&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At Netflix, we offer a personalized experience for interns, and our aim is to offer an experience that mimics what it is like to actually work here.

That’s why we are working every day to make our workforce as diverse as possible: the more variety our team has in our experience, interest, and backgrounds, the more likely we are to create truly great technologies. We also believe that our society as a whole benefits when we reach out to include a greater number of previously under-represented employees. To help us deliver on these promises, we invite you to voluntarily provide your gender identity, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. This information will never be used in making any hiring or employment decisions. We will use this data to track our progress towards achieving the diversity we seek at TRI.Do you consider yourself a member of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and/or Transgender, Queer and Questioning (LGBTQ) community?YesNoPrefer not to saySubmit application",
